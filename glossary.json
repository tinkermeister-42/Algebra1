  "factor tree": "A factor tree is a way to break a number into its smallest building blocks — the prime numbers that multiply to make it.",
  "calculus": "Calculus is a branch of math that helps us understand change and motion.",
  "vertical": "Up and down, like a flagpole.",
  "factoring": "Factoring means breaking something down into smaller parts that multiply together to make it.",
  "prime number": "A prime number has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.",

  "negative": "A number is negative if it is less than zero.",
  "number line": "A straight line used to show numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.",
  "numerator": "The numerator is the top number in a fraction. It tells how many parts you have.",
  "fraction": "A fraction shows a part of a whole. It has a {{< glink numerator >}} (top number) and a {{< glink denominator >}} (bottom number).",
