  "composite number": "A composite number has more than two factors.",
  "factor": "A factor is a whole number that divides another number evenly — with no remainder.",
  "number line": "A straight line used to show numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.",
