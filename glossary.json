  "fraction": "A fraction shows a part of a whole. It has a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).",
  "negative": "A number is negative if it is less than zero.",
  "simplify": "To simplify a number or expression means to rewrite it in a cleaner or shorter way — without changing its value. In math, we often simplify fractions, expressions, or equations to make them easier to work with.",

  "absolute value": "The distance a number is from zero on a number line, always expressed as a positive number or zero.",
  "composite number": "A composite number has more than two factors.",
  "improper fraction": "An improper fraction is a fraction where the top number (numerator) is equal to or greater than the bottom number (denominator). That means the value is 1 or more.",
  "factoring": "Factoring means breaking something down into smaller parts that multiply together to make it.",
  "number line": "A straight line used to show numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.",

  "sum": "A sum is the result of adding two or more numbers.",
  "vertical": "Up and down, like a flagpole.",
  "factor tree": "A factor tree is a way to break a number into its smallest building blocks — the prime numbers that multiply to make it.",

  "multiple": "A multiple is what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, and so on.",
  "percent": "A percent is a way of expressing a number out of 100. The symbol % means “per hundred.”",
  "convert": "To convert means to change a number from one form to another — like from a fraction to a decimal, or a decimal to a percent.",
  "prime number": "A number is prime if it has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.",
  "addition": "An operation that combines two or more numbers into a total.",
  "whole": "The whole is the total amount — it’s everything being considered before taking parts.",
  "markup": "A markup is the amount added to a cost to set a higher selling price, usually as a percent.",
  "expression": "A math sentence made up of numbers, variables, operations, and sometimes parentheses — but no equals sign.",
  "quotient": "A quotient is the result of dividing one number by another.",
  "discount": "A discount is an amount taken off the original price. It’s usually shown as a percent.",
  "number sense": "Number sense is a person’s ability to understand, work with, and think about numbers.",
  "prime factorization": "Prime factorization means writing a number as a product of prime numbers.",
  "equation": "An equation is a math sentence that says two things are equal.",
  "relatively prime": "Two numbers are relatively prime if they have no common factors other than 1.",
  "decimal": "A decimal is a number that uses a dot (.) to show values less than 1. It’s based on powers of 10.",
  "algebra": "Algebra is a branch of math that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and relationships.",
  "integer": "An integer is a whole number (not a fraction or decimal) that can be positive, negative, or zero.",
  "greatest common factor": "The greatest common factor (GCF) is the biggest number that divides evenly into two or more numbers. It is the largest factor they have in common.",
  "less than": "A number is less than (<) another number if it is further to the left on the number line.",
  "multiplication": "A math operation that means repeated addition or combining equal groups.",
  "place value": "Place value tells you how much each digit is worth based on where it is in the number.",
  "factor": "A factor is a whole number that divides another number evenly — with no remainder.",
  "division": "An operation that splits a number into equal parts.",
  "grade": "A grade often shows how well someone did using a percent or letter. It’s usually based on part out of whole.",
  "divisor": "A divisor is the number you divide by in a division problem. It tells you how many parts to split something into.",
  "opposite": "Two numbers that are the same distance from zero on a number line, but on opposite sides.",
  "product": "A product is the result of multiplying two or more numbers.",
  "positive": "A number is positive if it is greater than zero.",
