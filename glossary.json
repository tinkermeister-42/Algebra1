  "absolute value": "The distance a number is from zero on a number line, always expressed as a positive number or zero.",
  "greater than": "A number is greater than (>) another number if it is further to the right on the number line.",
  "number line": "A straight line used to represent numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left. Number lines help visualize operations and compare values.",
  "negative": "A number is negative if it is less than zero. On a number line, negative numbers are to the left of zero.",

  "opposite": "Two numbers that are the same distance from zero on a number line, but on opposite sides. Their sum is always zero.",
  "horizontal": "Side to side, like the horizon. Level ground is horizontal.",
  "less than": "A number is less than (<) another number if it is further to the left on the number line."
