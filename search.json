    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.1.1 - The Number Line Is More Than Just Counting\nYou already know how to count ‚Äî 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. The number line extends that idea in both directions.\nLet‚Äôs draw a number line from -10 to 10 \nHere, every tick mark is an integer ‚Äî a whole number.\n\nNumbers to the right of zero are positive\nNumbers to the left of zero are negative\n\nWe can use this number line to see what happens when we add, subtract, or compare numbers.\nAre there other ways to draw a number line?\nYes! Number lines can be drawn over different ranges and scales. For example, here is a number line that counts from -10 to 25 in steps of 5.\n\nIn fact, number lines don‚Äôt even have to be horizontal. Here is a vertical number line that goes from 0 to 100 in steps of 10.\n\n\nExample: How many numbers between 3 and 5?\nIf you are counting integers, there is 1 integer between 3 and 5 (just 4). But if you mean real numbers, there are infinitely many between 3 and 5. Here are some number lines that might help convince you.\n  \n\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nthermometer\nruler\ntimeline\nAmerican football field\nvolume slider on a phone\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 - Understanding Opposites\nLet‚Äôs look at a pair of numbers, 3 and -3.\nThese are called opposite numbers. They are the same distance from zero but on opposite sides of it.\n\n\nThe opposite of zero is zero. Zero is the only number that is its own opposite!\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 - What Is Absolute Value?\nAbsolute value measures the distance from zero. Absolute value is written as a number between two bars. For example, the absolute value of -5 is written \\(|-5|\\).\nTake a look at the number -5. The number line shows that its absolute value is 5 because it is 5 units away from zero. \nYou can see that |5| is also 5 for the same reason! \n\nAbsolute value is often used for describing the distance between two points. Suppose you live 3 miles to the east of the school and your best friend lives 5 miles to the west. How far apart are your houses? This is easy to see with a number line.\n\nYou can compute your distances by adding |-5| + |3|, by |-5 - 3|, or by |3 - (-5)|. All three of these give the same answer, 8 miles. What would change if we did not use absolute value?\n\n\nAbsolute value is never negative, because distance is never negative.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 - Comparing Integers\nWe can also use the number line to compare values.\nLet‚Äôs compare 2 to -7. \nYou can see from the number line that 2 is greater than (&gt;) -7 because 2 is to the right of -7.\nYou can also see that -7 is farther from zero than 2 and so |-7| &gt; |2|.\n\nIt is easy to get confused here. When we say which number is ‚Äúbigger‚Äù (or greater than), we are asking which number is farther to the right on the number line. This is not the same as absolute value, which asks which one is furthest from zero.\n\n\n3 &gt; -8 because it is farther to the right but |-8| &gt; |3| because -8 is farther from zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 - Number Lines and Arithmetic\nWe can also use the number line to model adding and subtracting integers.\n\nTo add a positive number, move right\nTo add a negative number, move left\n\nExamples:\n\nAddition: \\(-2 + 6 = 4\\) \n\n\nImagine that you are $2 in debt. If someone pays you $6 you can pay off the debt and have $\\(4\\) left over.\n\n\nAdding a negative: \\(150 + (-5) = 145\\) \n\n\nYou have $150 in the bank. The bank adds a fee for being under their $200 minimum balance. You now have $145.\n\n\nSubtraction: \\(400 - 450 = -50\\) \n\n\nIf you only have $400 but spend $450 on a credit card, you are now $50 in debt.\n\n\nSubtracting a negative: \\(201 - (-5) = 206\\) \n\n\n\nExample: The bank made a mistake, you had $\\(201\\) in your account so they took off the $\\(5\\) fee. Now you have $\\(206\\).",

It only has itself as a factor!\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 - What Are Multiples?\nA multiple is what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, 4‚Ä¶\nExample:\nHere are the first few multiples of 5:\n\\(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ...\\)\nWhere have we seen this before?\nMultiples show up all over the place. When you skip count, you are using multiples. In the previous lesson, we used multiples to construct number lines!\nExample:\nHere is a number line that shows multiples of three. \n\nIf a bus comes every 15 minutes, the arrival times are multiples of 15.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 - Prime vs.¬†Composite\nSome numbers can only be divided evenly two ways ‚Äî others can be broken into many parts. Let‚Äôs explore the difference between prime numbers and composite numbers.\nA prime number has only 2 factors: 1 and itself.\nExamples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13‚Ä¶\nA composite number has more than 2 factors.\nExamples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10‚Ä¶\n\nPeople around the world spend years searching for giant prime numbers. The largest ones we‚Äôve found so far have over 24 million digits!\nWhy go to all that trouble?\nPrime numbers are the secret behind modern encryption. They‚Äôre used to protect everything from bank accounts to private messages. The bigger the primes, the harder they are to break ‚Äî which is why finding huge ones is such a big deal.\nIt‚Äôs like a global math scavenger hunt‚Ä¶ with real-world consequences.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 - Prime Factorization and Factor Trees\nEvery number can be broken into a product of prime numbers ‚Äî sort of like breaking a LEGO¬Æ sculpture into individual bricks. These prime factors are the basic building blocks of all whole numbers.\nWe use factor trees to find these prime factors. This isn‚Äôt just a fun trick ‚Äî it builds your number sense: your ability to see patterns, understand how numbers are structured, and work confidently with them.\nThat number sense will come in handy later when you:\n\nSimplify fractions\nSolve equations\nFactor algebraic expressions\n\nLet‚Äôs build a factor tree for 360 to see how it works.\n\n\nSteps to Make a Factor Tree\n\nStart with a number:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    node_0(\"360\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.

This is helpful when you want to simplify a fraction!\nSimplifying a fraction means rewriting it in its simplest form. This makes a fraction as ‚Äúsmall‚Äù or ‚Äúbasic‚Äù as possible without changing its value. To do that, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCF. When a fraction is in its simplest form, the numerator and denominator don‚Äôt share any factors other than 1.\n\nLet‚Äôs go back to one we‚Äôve already seen:\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{60}\n\\]\nWe found earlier that the GCF of 36 and 60 is 12. So to simplify, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 12:\n\\[\n\\frac{36 \\div 12}{60 \\div 12} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\nThis is just like the division you saw in the factor trees. We canceled out the factors they both had ‚Äî two 2s and one 3 ‚Äî and kept what was left.\n\nHere‚Äôs another:\n\\[\n\\frac{90}{15}\n\\]\nWe know that 15 is the GCF of 90 and 15. So:\n\\[\n\\frac{90 \\div 15}{15 \\div 15} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6\n\\]\nThis tells us the fraction \\(\\frac{90}{15}\\) is just another way to write the number 6.\n\nIn other words:\n\nSimplifying a fraction is just dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.\n\nFactor trees help you see why this works by breaking the numbers into their building blocks.\n\nIf the numerator and denominator of a fraction share no common factors (besides 1) the two numbers are called relatively prime. In this case, the fraction cannot be simplified.\nExample:\nSimplify \\(\\frac{9}{38}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    node_0(\"9\")\n    node_1_0_1(\"3\")\n    node_0 --&gt; node_1_0_1\n    node_1_1_1(\"3\")\n    node_0 --&gt; node_1_1_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    node_0(\"38\")\n    node_1_0_1(\"2\")\n    node_0 --&gt; node_1_0_1\n    node_1_1_1(\"19\")\n    node_0 --&gt; node_1_1_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 9 and 38 share no factors, \\(\\frac{9}{38}\\) is already in simplest form.\n\n\nThe GCF of 30 and 90 is 30. \\[\n\\frac{30}{90} = \\frac{30 \\div 30}{90 \\div 30} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 ‚Äì Application: Simplifying with Recipes\nImagine you‚Äôre following a recipe that makes a giant batch of cookies ‚Äî way more than you need. You decide to cut the recipe down to a smaller size, but the measurements are a little awkward.\nHere‚Äôs what the recipe says:\n\n36 cups of flour\n60 cups of sugar\n\nYou don‚Äôt want to bake that much ‚Äî just a smaller, simpler version of the same cookie. But how do you shrink the recipe without changing how the cookies taste?\nLet‚Äôs treat the ingredients like a ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{36 \\text{ cups of flour}}{60 \\text{ cups of sugar}}\n\\]\nThis ratio tells us how much flour to use per amount of sugar. But the numbers are too big ‚Äî and a little messy.\nJust like with fractions, we can simplify this ratio by dividing both parts by their GCF. We already know the GCF of 36 and 60 is 12.\n\\[\n\\frac{36 \\div 12}{60 \\div 12} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\nSo for every 3 cups of flour, you need 5 cups of sugar.\nNow you can make a smaller batch that keeps the same balance by finding multiples of the numerator and denominator. For example:\n\n3 cups of flour\n5 cups of sugar\n\nOr double that:\n\n6 cups of flour\n10 cups of sugar\n\nSimplifying the original recipe helped you find a cleaner ratio ‚Äî one that‚Äôs easier to scale up or down, depending on how many cookies you want.\n\nSimplifying isn‚Äôt just a math trick ‚Äî it helps you work with numbers more easily in the real world. Whether you‚Äôre adjusting recipes, mixing paint, or scaling blueprints, understanding fractions and simplifying them makes life easier.",

You can change one form into another. Choose the form that fits the situation. In the next sections, you‚Äôll learn how to switch between them.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 ‚Äì Converting Fractions to Decimals\nHave you ever wondered why the division symbol (√∑) looks the way it does? It has two dots separated by a bar because it represents a fraction! This is because fractions are just a different way to show division. To convert a fraction to a decimal, all we have to do is divide the numerator by the denominator.\nLet‚Äôs try:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} = 3 \\div 4 = 0.75\n\\]\nWhen we convert to a decimal, we will see that some decimals end, and some repeat forever.\n\n\n\nFraction\nDecimal\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n0.25\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n0.333‚Ä¶\n\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n0.666‚Ä¶\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n0.2\n\n\n\nIf the decimal repeats, we write a bar over the repeating part: \\(\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}\\)\n\nWhen you use a calculator to turn a fraction into a decimal, the result might look like it stops, but that can be misleading!\nSome fractions have repeating decimals that go on forever ‚Äî but calculators round or cut them off.\nFor example:\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) really equals \\(0.\\overline{6}\\) (0.6666‚Ä¶) but your calculator might show 0.6666666667\nThis can cause small errors if you‚Äôre not careful ‚Äî especially when comparing values or converting back to fractions.\nüëâ Tip: If the decimal looks like it‚Äôs repeating (like 0.6666666667 or 0.14285714286‚Ä¶), it probably is!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat fractions have repeating decimals?\n\n\n\nAfter you simplify the fraction, look at the denominator. If it‚Äôs made only from 2s and/or 5s (like 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20), the decimal ends. If it has any other factor (like 3 or 7), the decimal repeats.\nExample 1:\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) has a denominator with factors 2 and 5. It ends and gives 0.3.\nExample 2\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) has a denominator with factors 2 and 3. It repeats and gives \\(0.\\overline{3}\\).\n\n\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that‚Ä¶ \\[\n\\frac{2}{5} = 2 \\div 5 = 0.4\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 - Converting Fractions and Decimals to Percents\nTurning a decimal into a percent is easy. We simply move the decimal point to the right twice (the same as multiplying by 100) and then add a % sign.\nExample: Convert 0.234 to a percent\nTo do this, we move the decimal two places to the right and then add a % sign. This gives us 23.4%.\n\nBut what if there isn‚Äôt a digit in the hundredths place? When we don‚Äôt have enough digits to the right of the decimal, we just fill them in with zeros.\nExample: Convert 0.4 to a percent.\n\nBut what if the number is bigger than 1? When the number is bigger than 1.0, we do exactly the same thing and end up with a percentage that is larger than 100%!\nExample: Convert 3.2 to a percent.\n\n\nWe multiply by 100 (move the decimal to the right twice) and add a % sign. This gives‚Ä¶ \\[1.342 \\times 100 = 134.2\\%\\]\n\n\nTo convert a fraction to a percent, we first convert the fraction to a decimal.\nExample: Convert \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) to a percent.\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\Rightarrow 3 \\div 5 = 0.6\n\\]\nNow we convert the decimal to a percent.\n\\[0.6 \\Rightarrow 60\\%\\]\n\nFirst convert to a decimal: \\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\Rightarrow 2 \\div 3 = 0.\\overline{6}\n\\] Now convert to a percent: \\[\n0.\\overline{6} \\Rightarrow 66.\\overline{6}\\%\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Converting Decimals to Fractions\nWhat if we want to go the other direction and convert a decimal to a fraction? The key to doing this is understanding place value.\nSuppose we have the number 123.456. The following table shows the place value for each digit.\n\n\n\nPlace\nValue\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nHundreds\n1\n1 hundred = 100\n\n\nTens\n2\n2 tens = 20\n\n\nOnes\n3\n3 ones = 3\n\n\nDecimal Point\n.\nSeparates whole from part\n\n\nTenths\n4\n4 tenths = \\(\\frac{4}{10}\\)\n\n\nHundredths\n5\n5 hundredths = \\(\\frac{5}{100}\\)\n\n\nThousandths\n6\n6 thousandths = \\(\\frac{6}{1000}\\)\n\n\n\nPlace value helps us say the number differently. Instead of saying ‚Äú123 point 456‚Äù we could say ‚Äú123 and 456 thousandths‚Äù. This is the trick to converting decimals to fractions.\nExample 1:\nSay we want to convert 0.75 to a fraction. We could say this is ‚Äúzero point seven five‚Äù but it is more useful to say this is ‚Äú75 hundredths‚Äù. This gives us our fraction!\n\\[\n0.75 = \\text{75 hundredths} \\Rightarrow \\frac{75}{100} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\nExample 2\nLet‚Äôs convert 0.1 into a fraction.\n\\[\n0.1 = \\text{1 tenth} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\nWhat if we have a number bigger than one?\nIf the number is bigger than one (like we saw with 4.23) we do the same thing, but we end up with a mixed number.\n\\[\n4.23 = \\text{4 and 23 hundredths} \\Rightarrow 4\\dfrac{23}{100}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you struggle with words like ‚Äúhundredths‚Äù here is another way to think about it. To convert a decimal to a fraction, count the number of digits to the right of the decimal. You will divide by 1 with that many zeros after it.\nExample: 0.5431\nThere are 4 digits to the right of the decimal point and so we divide by 1 with 4 zeros: \\[\n0.5431 = \\frac{5431}{10000}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n0.51 = \\text{51 hundredths} \\Rightarrow \\frac{51}{100}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 ‚Äì Converting Percents to Decimals and Fractions\nTo convert a percent to a decimal simply move the decimal two places left (the same as dividing by 100).\nFor example, here is what it looks like to convert 41% to a decimal. Notice that we sometimes have to add zeros to the left so the decimal has a place to go. Also notice that if there is no decimal, we put it just after the number before moving to the left.\n\nHere are some more examples:\n\n3.4% ‚Üí 0.034\n75% ‚Üí 0.75\n251% ‚Üí 2.51\n0.2% ‚Üí 0.002\n\n\nWe move the decimal to the left twice and remove the % sign. This gives‚Ä¶ \\[\n35\\% = 0.35\n\\]\n\nTo write a percent as a fraction, first convert to a decimal and then convert to a fraction, simplifying if possible:\n\n3.4% ‚Üí 0.034 ‚Üí \\(\\frac{34}{1000}\\) ‚Üí \\(\\frac{17}{500}\\)\n75% ‚Üí 0.75 ‚Üí \\(\\frac{75}{100}\\) ‚Üí \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\n251% ‚Üí 2.51 ‚Üí \\(\\frac{251}{100}\\)\n0.2% ‚Üí 0.002 ‚Üí \\(\\frac{2}{1000}\\) ‚Üí \\(\\frac{1}{500}\\)\n\n\nFirst, convert to a decimal and then to a fraction. \\[\n35\\% = 0.35 \\Rightarrow \\text{35 hundredths} \\Rightarrow \\frac{35}{100} = \\frac{7}{20}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.4.6 ‚Äì Bringing It All Together\nNow that you‚Äôve seen how to convert between fractions, decimals, and percents, here‚Äôs a summary table to help you remember the steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom\nTo\nHow to Convert\n\n\n\n\nFraction\nDecimal\nDivide the numerator by the denominator\n\n\nFraction\nPercent\nFirst convert to a decimal then convert to a percent\n\n\nDecimal\nFraction\nUse place value (write the fraction as you would say it)\n\n\nDecimal\nPercent\nMove the decimal two places right and add % sign\n\n\nPercent\nDecimal\nMove the decimal two places left and remove % sign\n\n\nPercent\nFraction\nFirst convert to a decimal and then convert to a fraction\n\n\n\n\nSome conversions are so common that it helps to memorize them.

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.5.1 ‚Äì Multiplying Fractions\nMultiplying by a fraction means finding a fraction of something else. In other words, you‚Äôre finding a part of a part.\nExample: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\)\nThis means:\n\none-fourth of one-half\n\nHere is what it looks like to find how many fourths are in one half:\n\nThat blue slice shows one of the four parts of the darker half.\nSince there are 8 total pieces, and only 1 is blue, the answer is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of the whole.\nDrawing pie charts every time we multiply would take forever‚Äîso here‚Äôs the shortcut:\n\nMultiply numerators together.\nMultiply denominators together. \\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{4 \\times 2} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3 \\times 4}{5 \\times 7} = \\frac{12}{35}\n\\]\n\n\nMultiplying Whole Numbers by Fractions\nNo denominator? No problem! Just put a 1 underneath:\nExample: \\(3 \\times \\frac{2}{5}\\) \\[\n3 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{\\color{red}1} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{6}{5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5}{\\color{red}1} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{5 \\times 3}{1 \\times 4} = \\frac{15}{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSimplifying After Multiplying\nThe smaller the numbers are, the easier they are to work with. Always simplify fractions when you can.\nExample: \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{9}{4}\\) \\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{2 \\times 9}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{18}{12}\n\\] Cancel out any common factors: \\[\n\\frac{18}{12}\n= \\frac{\\cancel{\\color{red}2} \\times (3 \\times \\cancel{\\color{red}3})}{\\cancel{\\color{red}3} \\times (\\cancel{\\color{red}2} \\times 2)}\n= \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you factor before you multiply, you get to skip a step. \\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{2 \\times 9}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{\\cancel{\\color{red}2} \\times (3 \\times \\cancel{\\color{red}3})}{\\cancel{\\color{red}3}  \\times (\\cancel{\\color{red}2} \\times 2)}\n= \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{8 \\times 3}{9 \\times 4} = \\frac{(\\cancel{\\color{red}2} \\times \\cancel{\\color{red}2} \\times 2) \\times \\cancel{\\color{red}3}}{(\\cancel{\\color{red}3} \\times 3) \\times (\\cancel{\\color{red}2} \\times \\cancel{\\color{red}2})} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 ‚Äì Multiplying Mixed Numbers\nA mixed number is a number that has a whole part and a fraction part, like \\(4\\tfrac{2}{3}\\). Before multiplying, we first need to convert to an improper fraction.\nExample: Multiply \\(4\\tfrac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{5}{6}\\)\nWe have 2 thirds, but how many thirds are in 4? To find out, multiply the whole number by the denominator: \\[\n4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\] Then add the numerator: \\[\n12 + 2 = 14\n\\] Now we know that there are 14 thirds in \\(4\\tfrac{2}{3}\\). \\[\n4\\tfrac{2}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\] Now we are ready to multiply: \\[\n\\frac{14}{3} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{35}{9}\n\\] Sometimes we need to convert back to a mixed number. Here is how we do that:\nFirst, divide: \\[\n35 \\div 9 = 3 \\text{ remainder 8}\n\\] Now we know we have 3 wholes and 8 remaining ninths. Together that is \\(3 \\tfrac{8}{9}\\).\n\nAnother Example: \\(2\\tfrac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\\)\nStep 1: Convert the mixed number. \\[\n2 \\times 4 = 8,\\quad 8 + 1 = 9 \\Rightarrow 2\\tfrac{1}{4} = \\frac{9}{4}\n\\] Step 2: Multiply: \\[\n\\frac{9}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{9 \\times \\cancel{\\color{red}4}}{\\cancel{\\color{red}4} \\times 5} = \\frac{9}{5} = 1\\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\nMixed numbers show up often, especially in cooking. If a recipe for 12 needs \\(3 \\frac{1}{2}\\) cups of flour, and we only want half (for 6 servings), we multiply: \\[\n3 \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{4}\n\\] Instead of measuring 7 times with a \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) cup, convert back to a mixed number: \\[\n\\frac{7}{4} = 1\\frac{3}{4} \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\n\n\\[\n3 \\tfrac{2}{3} \\times 4 \\tfrac{1}{2} = \\frac{11}{3} \\times \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{11 \\times (\\cancel{\\color{red}3} \\times 3)}{\\cancel{\\color{red}3} \\times 2} = \\frac{33}{2} = 16 \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 ‚Äì Division & Reciprocals\nDividing fractions? Easy‚Äîmeet the reciprocal. It flips fractions upside down!\n\nReciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)\nReciprocal of 5 is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\nTo divide fractions, multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor:\nExample: \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\div \\frac{1}{4}\\) \\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\div \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{\\color{red}4}{\\color{red}1} = \\frac{8}{3}\n\\] Dividing by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) asks, ‚ÄúHow many fourths are there in \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)?‚Äù\n\n\nDividing fractions is as easy as 1-2-3:\n\nKeep the first fraction.\nChange the division sign to multiplication.\nFlip the second fraction (use the reciprocal).\n\n\n\nZero has no reciprocal (you can‚Äôt divide by 0). For mixed numbers, convert to an improper fraction before taking the reciprocal.",

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.6.1 ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Part, Whole, or Percent?\nIn many real-world problems, you‚Äôre given some information and need to find what‚Äôs missing. Maybe you know the total price and the discount, and you want to know how much money you saved. Or you know how many questions you got right on a quiz, and you want to figure out your percent score.\nThese types of problems usually involve three pieces:\n\npart (how much you have),\nwhole (the total or full amount),\npercent (the portion out of 100).\n\nIf you know two of them, you can figure out the third. This formula helps:\n\\[\n\\text{part} = \\text{percent} \\times \\text{whole}\n\\]\nYou can also rearrange it to solve for the percent or the whole. We‚Äôll walk through all three types of problems step by step.\n\nConvert the percent to a decimal first!\n\n\nExample 1 ‚Äì Finding the Part\nWhat is 15% of 80?\nYou‚Äôre looking for a small part of 80 ‚Äî just 15 out of every 100. That‚Äôs what 15% means.\nWe can turn this into a math sentence by translating the words:\n\n‚Äúis‚Äù becomes equals (=)\n‚Äúof‚Äù becomes times (√ó)\n\nSo:\n\n\n\nwhat\nis\n15%\nof\n80?\n\n\n\n\n?\n=\n0.15\n\\(\\times\\)\n80\n\n\n\nNow solve it:\n\\[\n0.15√ó80=12\n\\]\nSo 12 is 15% of 80.\n\nTurn it into a math sentence:\n\n\n\nwhat\nis\n10%\nof\n50?\n\n\n\n\n?\n=\n0.10\n√ó\n50\n\n\n\nThen multiply: \\[\n0.10 \\times 50 = 5\n\\] Answer: 5\n\n\nExample 2 ‚Äì Finding the Percent\nOut of 50 students, 30 say they like soccer. What percent is that?\nThe phrase out of tells us that 50 is the whole and 30 is the part. We can write that as a fraction, then convert it into a percent.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} = \\frac{30}{50} = 0.6 = 60\\%\n\\]\nSo 60% of students like soccer.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{75} = 0.04 = 4\\%\n\\] So only 4% of students get enough sleep!\n\n\nExample 3 ‚Äì Finding the Whole\n25% of a number is 10. What is the number?\nWe‚Äôre told that 10 is 25% of the total. That means 10 is just a piece ‚Äî one-fourth ‚Äî of the whole. (Since \\(25\\% = \\frac{1}{4}\\).)\nIf one-fourth of something is 10, then we can picture the whole as being made up of 4 equal parts of 10:\n\\[\n10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n\\]\nSo the whole is 40.\nBut what if the fractions are harder to think about than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)? Here‚Äôs a trick:\n25% as a decimal is 0.25. If we want to know,\n\n‚Äú25% of what number gives me 10?‚Äù\n\nwe can work backward by dividing:\n\\[\n10 \\div 0.25 = 40\n\\]\nSo the total is still 40 ‚Äî it is just another way to get the same answer.\n\nStart by thinking:\n\\(20\\% = \\frac{1}{5}\\) ‚Üí So if one-fifth is 12, then the whole must be: \\[\n12 \\times 5 = 60\n\\] Or use division:\n\\[\n12 \\div 0.2 = 60\n\\] Answer: 60\n\n\n\n\n1.6.2 ‚Äì Real-Life Examples\n\nGrades\nYour teacher hands you back your Unit 1 quiz. You got 19 out of 20 points! What is your grade?\nGrades are given as percentages so we want to figure out what \\(\\frac{19}{20}\\) is as a percent.\n\\[\n\\frac{19}{20} = 0.95 = 95\\%\n\\]\nYou got 95% on that assignment, that‚Äôs an A!\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{25} = 0.8 = 80\\%\n\\] John got an 80% which is a B.\n\n\n\n\nSales & Discounts\nA clothing store is having a back-to-school sale. A $60 jacket is on sale for 25% off.\nWhat‚Äôs the new price?\nFirst, find the discount by asking ‚ÄúWhat is 25% of $60?‚Äù:\n\n\n\nwhat\nis\n25%\nof\n$60?\n\n\n\n\n?\n=\n0.25\n√ó\n60\n\n\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\nThis tells us we will save $15. To find the new price we subtract:\n\\[\n60 - 15 = 45\n\\]\nThe jacket now costs $45.\n\nFind the discount:\n\n\n\nwhat\nis\n65%\nof\n$300?\n\n\n\n\n?\n=\n0.65\n√ó\n300\n\n\n\n\\[\n0.65 \\times 300 = 195\n\\] Now subtract to get the sale price: \\[\n300 - 195 = 105\n\\] Swanhilda pays $105 for the dress. What a steal!\n\n\n\n\nSurveys & Data\nA survey of teachers asked whether they prefer cookies or cake. The survey found that 75% prefer cookies.

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.7.1 ‚Äì The Order Matters\nIn math, the order you do things really matters ‚Äî doing steps out of order can completely change the answer.\nTake this simple-looking problem:\n\\[\n10 + 3 \\times 5\n\\]\nLet‚Äôs try solving it from left to right:\n\\[\n\\color{red}10 + 3 \\color{black}\\times 5 = \\color{red}13 \\color{black}\\times 5 = 65\n\\]\nNow let‚Äôs try doing the multiplication first:\n\\[\n10 + \\color{red}3 \\times 5 \\color{black} = 10 + \\color{red}15 \\color{black} = 25\n\\]\nSo which one is correct ‚Äî 65 or 25?\n‚úÖ The correct answer is 25, because we follow a specific order of operations. Without these rules, people could get different answers to the same problem!\nLet‚Äôs look at the rules:\n\nWe often remember the order using PEMDAS:\n\nP ‚Äì Parentheses \\((...)\\)\nE ‚Äì Exponents (like \\(3^2\\))\nM/D ‚Äì Multiplication (\\(\\times\\)) and Division (\\(\\div\\))\nA/S ‚Äì Addition (\\(+\\)) and Subtraction (\\(-\\))\n\nNote:\n\nMultiplication and division are on the same level. Do them left to right.\nThe same goes for addition and subtraction.\n\nYou can think of it like a ladder. You start at the top and climb your way down!\n\n\nBecause they are two sides of the same operation. Any division problem can be rewritten as multiplication by using the reciprocal.\n\nExample: \\(12 \\div \\frac{3}{2}\\) becomes \\(12 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 8\\)\n\nThe same is true for addition and subtraction. Subtraction is really just adding the opposite.\n\nExample: \\(5 - 2\\) becomes \\(5 + (-2) = 3\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.2 ‚Äì Examples with Integers\nLet‚Äôs look at some expressions that follow the order of operations. These use only whole numbers ‚Äî no fractions or negatives yet.\nExample 1: \\(5 + 3 \\times 2\\)\nFirst, do the multiplication:\n\\[\n5 + \\color{red}3 \\times 2 \\color{black} = 5 + \\color{red}6\n\\]\nThen do the addition:\n\\[\n5 + 6 = 11\n\\]\n\nExample 2: \\((5 + 3) \\times 2\\)\nFirst, simplify the parentheses:\n\\[\n\\color{red}(5 + 3) \\color{black} \\times 2 = \\color{red}8 \\color{black} \\times 2\n\\]\nThen multiply:\n\\[\n8 \\times 2 = 16\n\\]\n\nExample 3: \\(8 - 12 \\div 3\\)\nFirst, divide:\n\\[\n8 - \\color{red}12 \\div 3 \\color{black} = 8 - \\color{red}4\n\\]\nThen subtract:\n\\[\n8 - 4 = 4\n\\]\n\n\nStart with parentheses: \\[\n5\\color{red}(8 - 1)\\color{black} + 2 \\times 3 = 5 \\times \\color{red}7 \\color{black} + 2 \\times 3\n\\] Next, do the multiplication: \\[\n\\color{red}5 \\times 7 \\color{black} + \\color{red}2 \\times 3 \\color{black} = \\color{red}35 \\color{black} + \\color{red}6\n\\] Finally, add: \\[\n35 + 6 = 41\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.7.3 ‚Äì With Negatives and Fractions\nOnce you‚Äôre comfortable with the basics, we can add in negative numbers and fractions. The order of operations still works the same way ‚Äî you just have to be more careful.\nExample 1: \\(-3 \\times (4 - 7)\\)\nFirst, simplify the parentheses:\n\\[\n-3 \\times \\color{red}(4 - 7)\\color{black} = -3 \\times \\color{red}-3\n\\]\nThen multiply. Remember: a negative times a negative is positive.\n\\[\n-3 \\times -3 = 9\n\\]\n\nWhat does multiplying by a negative number do?\nIt reverses the sign of the number it‚Äôs multiplied by.\nExample:\n\\(3 \\times -1 = -3\\) ‚Üí the positive 3 becomes negative\nNow try it with a negative number:\nExample:\n\\(-3 \\times -1 = 3\\) ‚Üí the negative 3 becomes positive\nSo multiplying by \\(-1\\) always gives the opposite sign.\nThat‚Äôs why \\(-3 \\times -1 = 3\\) ‚Äî the opposite of negative 3 is positive 3.\n\n\nExample 2: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (6 + 2)\\)\nFirst, simplify the parentheses:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\color{red}(6 + 2)\\color{black} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\color{red}8\n\\]\nThen multiply:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{8}{1} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\nExample 3: \\(\\frac{3 + 5}{2}\\)\nThis fraction means to divide after you do the work on top.\nEven though there are no parentheses, the fraction bar acts like grouping symbols ‚Äî just like parentheses.\nSo:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\color{red}{3 + 5}}{2} = \\frac{\\color{red}{8}}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\n\nFirst do the parentheses: \\[\n-3 \\times \\color{red}(4 - 7) \\color{black} = -3 \\times \\color{red}{-3}\n\\] Then multiply: \\[\n-3 \\times -3 = 9\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.7.4 ‚Äì More Complex Expressions\nLet‚Äôs try putting all the steps together. When expressions involve grouping, exponents, fractions, and multiple operations, PEMDAS really helps keep things organized.\nExample: \\(4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (6 - 2)^2\\)\nStep 1: Parentheses\n\\[\n4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\color{red}{(6 - 2)}^{\\color{black}2} \\color{black} = 4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\color{red}{4}\\color{black}^{2}\n\\]\nStep 2: Exponents\n\\[\n4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\color{red}{4^2}\\color{black} = 4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\color{red}{16}\n\\]\nStep 3: Multiplication \\[\n4 + \\color{red}{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 16}\\color{black} = 4 + \\color{red}{8}\n\\]\nStep 4: Addition \\[\n\\color{red}{4 + 8}\\color{black} = 12\n\\]\n\nWithout parentheses, you might square the wrong number. Always follow PEMDAS and work inside parentheses first ‚Äî especially when there are multiple layers.\n\n\n\\(-3^2\\) means \\(-(3^2)\\), which is: \\[\n-(3^2) = -9\n\\] But \\((-3)^2\\) means the negative is part of the base: \\[\n(-3)^2 = 9\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nNested Parentheses\nSometimes, expressions use more than one layer of grouping. When that happens:\n\nAlways work from the inside out\nBrackets \\([\\,]\\) or braces \\(\\{\\,\\}\\) might be used to help keep things clear\n\n\nExample:\n\\[\n\\left[ 3 + (2^2 + 1) \\right] \\times 2\n\\]\n\nStep 1: Inner parentheses\n\\[\n\\left[ 3 + \\color{red}{(2^2 + 1)} \\color{black}\\right] \\times 2 = \\left[ 3 + \\color{red}{5} \\right] \\times 2\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Brackets\n\\[\n\\color{red}{\\left[ 3 + 5 \\right]} \\color{black} \\times 2 = \\color{red}{8} \\color{black} \\times 2\n\\]\n\nStep 3: Multiply\n\\[\n\\color{red}{8 \\times 2} \\color{black} = 16\n\\]\n\n\nPEMDAS starts with grouping, and that means more than just parentheses!\nThese all group parts of an expression:\n\n\\((...)\\) ‚Äî parentheses\n\\([\\,]\\) or \\(\\{\\,\\}\\) ‚Äî brackets/braces (used for nesting)\nFraction bars \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)\nSquare roots \\(\\sqrt{a + b}\\)\n\nAlways simplify grouped expressions before applying exponents or multiplying.\n\n\nStep 1: Inner parentheses\n\\[\n\\left[ 5 + \\color{red}{(3^2 - 1)} \\right] \\times 2 = \\left[ 5 + \\color{red}{8} \\right] \\times 2\n\\] Step 2: Brackets\n\\[\n\\color{red}{\\left[ 5 + 8 \\right]} \\color{black} \\times 2 = \\color{red}{13} \\color{black} \\times 2\n\\] Step 3: Multiply\n\\[\n\\color{red}{13 \\times 2} \\color{black} = 26\n\\] ‚úÖ Final Answer: 26\n\n\n\n\n1.7.5 ‚Äì Why This Matters\nThis might feel like just number-crunching, but it lays the foundation for Algebra. You‚Äôll need these skills to simplify expressions, solve equations, and understand formulas.\nLater in Algebra, you‚Äôll see variables, combining like terms, and the distributive property. If you can‚Äôt simplify numbers correctly, the rest will fall apart.\n\nYou get a 25% off coupon and a $10 gift card. The item costs $40.\nWhich should be applied first?\n\n25% off first ‚Üí $40 √ó 0.75 = $30 ‚Üí $30 - $10 = $20\nGift card first ‚Üí $40 - $10 = $30 ‚Üí 25% off = $22.50\n\nSame ingredients, different result.

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n2.1.1 ‚Äì What Is a Variable?\nSometimes we need to talk about a number we don‚Äôt know yet ‚Äî or one that can change. For that, we use a variable.\nA variable is a letter or symbol that stands for an unknown or changing number. Algebra often uses x, but other letters work too.\nThink of x as the label on a mystery box: you know there‚Äôs a number inside, but you don‚Äôt know which one.\nExample:\nYou work at a grocery store. Your boss gives you labels and points to boxes of apples:\n‚ÄúWrite how many apples are in each box.‚Äù\nYou pick up a sealed box. You can‚Äôt see inside, so you write x on the label ‚Äî x means ‚Äúthe number of apples in this box (unknown).‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nYour boss says, ‚ÄúCheck inside.‚Äù You open the box: there are 3 apples.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you know the number, so you change the label to 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore opening it, x was a variable ‚Äî a placeholder for an unknown number. After looking, you found \\(x = 3\\).\n\n\n\n2.1.2 ‚Äì What Is an Expression?\nAn expression is a math phrase made of numbers, variables, and operations. Expressions do not compare values ‚Äî so \\(2x\\) and \\(5\\) are expressions, but \\(2x = 5\\) is not (that‚Äôs an equation).\nExamples of expressions:\n\n\\(3x\\)\n\\(2x - 7\\)\n\\(\\tfrac{1}{2}(y + 4)\\)\n\\(x^2 - 3x + 4\\)\n\\(9\\)\n\nNot expressions:\n\n\\(3x + 5 = 20\\) (equation ‚Äî has an equals sign)\n\n\\(x &gt; 7\\) (comparison)\n\n\nYou have two situations:\n\nThe total number of pencils in 7 boxes.\nWhether the total number of pencils is equal to 20.\n\n\nCan situation 1 be represented with a single expression?\nHow about situation 2?\nExplain your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\nSituation 1: Yes ‚Äî you can write 7p if p is pencils per box.\nSituation 2: No ‚Äî this is a comparison, not a single expression.\n\nExpressions describe quantities; they don‚Äôt make comparisons.\n\nExample:\nBack to the apple boxes: before, you had one box. Now suppose you have 5 boxes, each with x apples.\n\n    \n\nIf each box has x apples, then the total is \\(5 \\cdot x\\) or simply \\(5x\\).\n\nLet \\(p\\) = pencils per box.\nTotal pencils = \\(10p\\)\n\n\nIn algebra, we usually don‚Äôt use \\(\\times\\) for multiplication. Instead, we use a dot ‚Äú\\(\\cdot\\)‚Äù or simply place terms next to each other (multiplication by proximity).\nThree ways to write ‚Äú3 times x‚Äù:\n\n\\(3 \\times x\\) (rarely used)\n\n\\(3 \\cdot x\\)\n\n\\(3x\\)\n\nWhy avoid \\(\\times\\)? To keep it from looking like the variable x.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 ‚Äì Terms, Coefficients, and Constants\nExpressions are made of terms. A term may have a variable with a coefficient (the number in front) or be a constant (a number without a variable).\nExample: \\(4x + 2y - 7\\)\n\\[\n\\huge{\n\\underbrace{\\color{blue}{4}\\color{black}{x}^2}_{\\text{term}}\n\\;\n\\underbrace{+\\color{blue}{2}\\color{black}{y}}_{\\text{term}}\n\\;\n\\underbrace{-\\color{red}{7}}_{\\text{term}}\n}\n\\]\n\nTerms are separated by \\(+\\) or \\(-\\): \\(4x^2\\), \\(2y\\), \\(-7\\)\nCoefficients multiply a variable: \\(\\color{blue}{4}\\) and \\(\\color{blue}{2}\\)\n\nConstants are numbers that don‚Äôt change: \\(\\color{red}{-7}\\)\n\n\n\nThe sign (+ or ‚àí) belongs to the term.\n\nA lone variable has an implied coefficient of 1.\n\nExample 1:\n\\(-5x^2 - 2x\\) ‚Üí terms: \\(-5x^2\\), \\(-2x\\); coefficients: -5, -2\nExample 2:\n\\(3x^2 + x - y\\) ‚Üí terms: \\(3x^2\\), \\(x\\), \\(-y\\); coefficients: 3, 1, -1\n\n\nExample: \\(18x - 2y + 3z - 1\\)\nTerms: \\(18x\\), \\(-2y\\), \\(3z\\), \\(-1\\)\nCoefficients: 18, -2, 3\nConstant: -1\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 ‚Äì Translating Between Words and Expressions\nExpressions are math phrases that describe real situations. Learning to turn words into expressions is one of the most important skills in algebra because it connects math to real life ‚Äî and it‚Äôs the first step to solving real-world problems.\n\nExamples:\n\nYou have 5 boxes of apples. Each box has x apples.\nNumber of apples: \\(5x\\)\nYou earn $12 per hour for h hours.\nTotal earnings: \\(12h\\)\nYour friend has n games.

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n2.2.1 ‚Äì What Does It Mean to Evaluate?\nTo evaluate an expression means to find its value by substituting (replacing) the variable with a number.\nExample 1:\nEvaluate \\(4x + 1\\) when \\(x = 3\\).\nFirst we replace the \\(x\\) with what it is.\n\\[\n4(\\color{red}3\\color{black}) + 1\n\\]\nNow we simplify (or calculate) the result.\n\\[\n4(3) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\\]\n\nWhen you see ‚Äú=‚Äù, think ‚Äúis‚Äù. In the previous example, we could say ‚Äúx is 3‚Äù.\n\nExample 2:\nEvaluate \\(3 - 2x\\) when \\(x = -4\\).\nFirst substitute.\n\\[\n3 - 2(\\color{red}{-4}\\color{black})\n\\]\nThen simplify.\n\\[\n3 - 2(-4) = 3 + 8 = 11\n\\]\n\nIt is easy to lose track of negative signs when substituting numbers in an expression. To avoid mistakes, put parentheses in place of the variable before substituting a number.\n\n\n\\[\n5(\\color{red}-3\\color{black}) - 2 = -15 - 2 = -17\n\\]\n\nNow that you know how to evaluate an expression, let‚Äôs try some more complicated ones that will require us to remember our order of operations.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 ‚Äì Using PEMDAS with Substitution\nEvaluating expressions is just one additional step on top of the order of operations. First we substitute, and then we apply PEMDAS.\nExample 1:\nEvaluate \\(2(x + 3)^2\\) when \\(x = 1\\).\nFirst we substitute.\n\\[\n2((\\color{red}{1}\\color{black}) + 3)^2\n\\]\nThen we simplify.\n\\[\n2(1 + 3)^2 = 2(4)^2 = 2 \\cdot 16 = 32\n\\]\nExample 2:\nEvaluating expressions works the same way if the variable shows up more than once. This expression has the variable \\(y\\) in two places.\nEvaluate \\(3(2 - y) + 5(y - 2)\\) when \\(y=-4\\).\nSubstitute:\n\\[\n3(2 - (\\color{red}{-4})\\color{black}) + 5((\\color{red}{-4}\\color{black}) - 2)\n\\]\nNow simplify:\n\\[\n3(2 -(-4)) + 5((-4) - 2) = 3(6) + 5(-6) = 18 - 30 = -12\n\\]\n\nSubstitute: \\[\n20((\\color{red}{5}\\color{black}) - 2) + 2(\\color{red}{5}\\color{black})^2\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n20(5 - 2) + 2(5)^2 = 20(3) + 2(25) = 60 + 50 = 110\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 ‚Äì Evaluating Expressions With Multiple Variables\nIt may look more difficult, but there is no difference between evaluating expressions with one variable and evaluating them with 2 or more variables.\nIn the following example, we have the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nExample 1:\nEvaluate the expression \\(2a - 3b\\) when \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=1\\).\nWe do exactly what we did in the previous examples. First we substitute for \\(\\color{blue}{a}\\) and \\(\\color{red}{b}\\):\n\\[\n2(\\color{blue}{2}\\color{black}) - 3(\\color{red}{1}\\color{black})\n\\]\nThen we simplify:\n\\[\n2(2) - 3(1) = 4 - 3 = 1\n\\]\nExample 2:\nEvaluate \\(12x -3y^2\\) when \\(x=7\\) and \\(y=-3\\).\nFirst substitute for \\(\\color{blue}{x}\\) and \\(\\color{red}{y}\\). Be careful with the negatives!\n\\[\n12(\\color{blue}{7}\\color{black}) - 3(\\color{red}{-3}\\color{black})^2\n\\]\nNow we simplify:\n\\[\n12(7) - 3(-3)^2 = 84 - 3(9) = 84 - 27 = 57\n\\]\n\nFirst substitute for \\(\\color{blue}{x}\\) and \\(\\color{red}{y}\\).\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(\\color{blue}{4}\\color{black})^2 - 3(\\color{red}{3}\\color{black})\n\\]\nNow simplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(4)^2-3(3) = \\frac{1}{2}(16)-9=8-9=-1\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 ‚Äì Testing For Equivalence\nSometimes two expressions look different but always give the same result. We call these equivalent expressions.\nTo test for equivalence, we can substitute values into each expression and see if they give the same result.\nExample 1:\nTest if the expressions \\(5x - 25\\) and \\(5(x - 5)\\) are equivalent.\nLet‚Äôs try \\(x=9\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n5(9) - 25 &= 45 - 25 &= 20 \\\\\n5(9 - 5) &= 5(4) &= 20\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThey both gave the same result and so we have evidence that the two expressions are equivalent.\nExample 2:\nTest if expressions \\(3(x - 1)\\) and \\(3x - 2\\) are equivalent.\nLet‚Äôs try \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3((2)-1) &= 3(1) &= 3 \\\\\n3(2) - 2 &= 6 - 2 &= 4\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThese two expressions are not equivalent because they give different results when substituting the same number for \\(x\\).\n\nWhen we substitute numbers to check if two expressions are equivalent, we are really testing a hypothesis:\n\nIf the two expressions give different results for the same substitution, then they are not equivalent.\nIf the two expressions give the same result for a substitution, that is evidence that they are equivalent, but it does not prove they are always the same.\n\nExample: Test if \\(6y\\) and \\(2y\\) are equivalent expressions.\nTry \\(y = 0\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n6(0) &= 0 \\\\\n2(0) &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe got the same result, so this is evidence that they could be equivalent.\nBut what if we try \\(y=3\\)?\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n6(3) &= 18 \\\\\n2(3) &= 6\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThis proves that the expressions are not equivalent.\nFor now we can only test the hypothesis. In section 2.6 we will learn how to prove two expressions are equivalent.\n\n\n\nTest if \\(9y - 3\\) is equivalent to \\(3(3y - 2) + 3\\) using \\(y = 2\\).\nDid you get the same result? What does your answer tell you about the two expressions?\n\n\nIf we substitute \\(y = 2\\) we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n9(2) - 3 &= 18 - 3 &= 15 \\\\\n3(3(2) - 2) + 3 &= 3(6 - 2) + 3 = 3(4) + 3 = 12 + 3 &= 15\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe have evidence that the two expressions are equivalent but we don‚Äôt know for certain.",

Let‚Äôs group by type to clean it up.\n\nNow it‚Äôs easy to see how many you have of each kind‚Äîand it looks better for customers.\nAlgebraic expressions can be messy in the same way. Different kinds of terms get mixed together. To simplify, we first group by type before adding things up.\nWhat do we mean by ‚Äútype‚Äù?\nTwo terms are the same type if their variable part (letters and exponents) matches exactly. We call these like terms.\nLike terms\n\n\\(5x\\) and \\(3x\\)\n\\(7\\) and \\(-3\\) (both are constants)\n\\(2y^3\\) and \\(y^3\\)\n\\(8xy\\) and \\(2yx\\) (the order of the variables doesn‚Äôt matter)\n\nNot like terms\n\n\\(2x\\) and \\(3y\\)\n\\(4x^2\\) and \\(2x^4\\)\n\\(7\\) and \\(-3x\\)\n\\(3x^2y\\) and \\(3xy^2\\)\n\n\nThe sign (+ or -) belongs with the term. In \\(7x - 2x\\) the terms are \\(+7x\\) and \\(-2x\\).\n\n\nAlways remember that the powers need to be the same. That means terms like \\(p^3\\) and \\(p^2\\) are not like terms. They have the same variable ‚Äúp‚Äù but they do not have the same exponents.\n\n\n\n\\(5\\) and \\(-42\\)\n\\(32y\\) and \\(32x\\)\n\\(9x^2y^3\\) and \\(9x^3y^2\\)\n\\(-\\frac{1}{3}a^4\\) and \\(1.5a^4\\)\n\\(252xyz\\) and \\(525yxz\\)\n\n\n\nPairs: a, d, and e\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 ‚Äì How to Combine Like Terms (Sort ‚Üí Group ‚Üí Add)\nNow that you can identify like terms, let‚Äôs see how to use this to help us simplify expressions.\nExample 1:\nIn this messy expression, there are several terms of different types. Like with the fruit, it is difficult to see what we have.\n\\[\n9a + 4c + 8b - 3a + b - 2c + 2a - 6b - 4a\n\\]\nStep 1: To clean it up, let‚Äôs sort by type.\n\\[\n9a -3a +2a -4a + 4c - 2c + 8b + b - 6b\n\\]\nStep 2: Now we group the like terms together.\n\\[\n(9a - 3a + 2a - 4a) + (4c - 2c) + (8b + b - 6b)\n\\]\nStep 3: To simplify we can add things up in each group.\n\\[\n4a + 2c + 3b\n\\]\nIn the same way that it became easy to count the different types of fruit, it is now obvious that we have 4 a‚Äôs, 2 c‚Äôs, and 3 b‚Äôs. This process of sorting, grouping, and adding things up is called combining like terms. Doing this makes working with algebraic expressions much easier.\n\nWe can change the order because addition is commutative (and subtraction is adding a negative).\nWe can then group terms together because addition is associative.\n\nExample 2\nSimplify the following expression.\n\\[\n-1.5x + 2.5 + 3.5x^2 - 0.5 + 5.5x - 2 - 4.0x - 4.5x^2\n\\]\nFirst, sort the terms by type:\n\\[\n3.5x^2 - 4.5x^2 -1.5x + 5.5x - 4.0x + 2.5 -0.5 -2.0\n\\]\nNext, group like terms:\n\\[\n(3.5x^2 - 4.5x^2) + (-1.5x + 5.5x - 4.0x) + (2.5 - 0.5 - 2.0)\n\\]\nFinally, add up the coefficients in each group.\n\\[\n-1.0x^2 + 0.0x + 0.0 = -x^2\n\\]\n\nIn the previous example, notice what happened when we grouped the \\(x\\) terms. The negative stayed with \\(-1.5x\\). We had to put a ‚Äú+‚Äù sign in between the \\(x^2\\) group and the \\(x\\) group.\nWhat would happen if we forgot that the negative stayed with the term?\nIf we forgot, then the whole \\(x\\) group would become negative.\n\\[\n\\color{gray}(3.5x^2 - 4.5x^2)\\color{black} - \\color{red}{(1.5x + 5.5x - 4.0x)} \\color{gray}+ (2.5 - 0.5 - 2.0)\n\\]\nBut that simplifies to a very different incorrect answer!:\n\\[\n\\color{gray}-x^2 \\color{red} -3.0x\n\\]\n\n\nImagine you are on a field trip with your class and the bus stops to order fast food. If there are 50 people on the bus, it would be crazy to place each order individually, it would take forever.\nSo, instead of making individual orders like, ‚ÄúOne cheeseburger with fries and a drink.‚Äù 50 times. It would make more sense to group by type and make one order.\n‚ÄúWe need 28 cheeseburgers, 22 plain burgers, 40 orders of fries, and 35 drinks‚Äù.\nThe person taking orders (and the people behind you in line) will appreciate that you can combine like terms!\n\n\n\\[\n5z^3 + 5z^3 - 3z^2 - z^2 + 2z -z -8 =\n\\] \\[\n(5z^3 + 5z^3) + (-3z^2 - z^2) + (2z - z) + (-8) =\n\\] \\[\n10z^3 - 4z^2 + z - 8\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 ‚Äì Checking Your Work\nWhen simplifying expressions it is easy to make a mistake. If you are unsure, test with numbers and substitution.\n\\[\n5x - 3x^2 + 2x - 7 + 3x^2 + 3 =\n\\] \\[\n-3x^2 + 3x^2 + 5x + 2x - 7 + 3 =\n\\] \\[\n(-3x^2 + 3x^2) + (5x + 2x) + (-7 + 3) =\n\\] \\[\n7x - 4\n\\]\nLet‚Äôs evaluate both expressions when \\(x=2\\).\n\\[\n5(2) - 3(2)^2 + 2(2) - 7 + 3(2)^2 + 3 =\n\\] \\[\n10 - 12 + 4 - 7 + 12 + 3 = 10\n\\]\nAnd‚Ä¶\n\\[\n7(2) - 4 =\n\\] \\[\n14 - 4 = 10\n\\]\nThis is evidence that we combined like terms correctly.\n\nSimplify the expression by combining like terms. \\[\n3b + 4b - 2 - 5 = 7b - 7\n\\]\nWe could pick any non-zero number. Let‚Äôs try \\(b = 3\\):\nIn the original expression we get 14. \\[\n3(3) + 4(3) - 2 - 5 = 9 + 12 - 2 - 5 = 14\n\\]\nWe also get 14 in our simplified expression!\n\\[\n7(3) - 7 = 21 - 7 = 14\n\\]",

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n2.4.1 ‚Äì What Is the Distributive Property?\nThe distributive property says:\n\\[\na(b+c) = ab + ac \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad a(b-c)=ab-ac.\n\\]\nThink of an area model. A rectangle with side lengths \\((x+3)\\) and \\(4\\) can be split into two smaller rectangles: one \\(x\\) by \\(4\\) and one \\(3\\) by \\(4\\).\n\nSo the total area is \\(4x + 12\\). That‚Äôs distribution in pictures.\nExamples\n\n\\(3(x+2)=3x+6\\)\n\\(5(y-4)=5y-20\\)\n\\(2(4a+3b)=8a+6b\\)\n\n\n\n\\(5(x+7)\\)\n\\(2(3+y)\\)\n\\(4(a+3b)\\)\n\\(10(x-0.5)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(5x+35\\) ¬†¬† b) \\(6+2y\\) or \\(2y+6\\) ¬†¬† c) \\(4a+12b\\) ¬†¬† d) \\(10x-5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 ‚Äì Distributing with Negatives\nCareful with signs. The sign in front of the parentheses multiplies every term inside.\nExamples\n\n\\(-3(x-4) = -3x + 12\\)\n\\(-(x+7)= -x - 7\\) (think ‚Äú\\(-1\\) times each term‚Äù)\n\\(6 - 2(x+3) = 6 - 2x - 6 = -2x\\)\n\n\n\\(4(x+2y+5)\\) means \\(4x + 8y + 20\\). Distribute to every term, not just the first two.\n\n\n\\[\n-6 + 2y + 4y + 20 = 6y + 14\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 ‚Äì Distribute, Then Combine Like Terms\nWe often distribute and then use what we learned in 2.3 (combine like terms).\nExample\n\\[\n4(x+2) + 3(x-5) = 4x + 8 + 3x - 15 = 7x - 7.\n\\]\nSometimes you can simplify inside first:\n\\[\n2(x+3x-5)=2(4x-5)=8x-10,\n\\]\nwhich is a little faster.\n\nIf you can combine inside the parentheses first, do it. If not, distribute and then combine like terms.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 ‚Äì Why It Works (Another Look)\nDistribution turns ‚Äúgroups of a sum‚Äù into a ‚Äúsum of groups.‚Äù\nWord picture: A club sells a snack bundle: each bundle has \\(x\\) cookies and 3 candies. If you buy 4 bundles, you get \\(4x\\) cookies and \\(12\\) candies: \\(4(x+3)=4x+12.\\)\n\nBuying 7 ‚Äú\\(x\\)-dollar passes and a $2 fee‚Äù costs \\(7(x+2)=7x+14\\). The per-person cost (\\(x\\)) and the fixed fee (2) both get multiplied by 7.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5 ‚Äì Reverse It: Factoring Out a Common Factor\nDistribution goes both ways. If \\(ab+ac = a(b+c)\\), then we can factor out \\(a\\).\nExamples\n\n\\(8x+12 = 4(2x+3)\\)\n\\(15x-9 = 3(5x-3)\\)\n\\(3x+6y = 3(x+2y)\\)\n\nThis is called factoring (using a greatest common factor, if possible).\n\n\n\\(12x+18\\) ¬†¬† b) \\(9a-6\\) ¬†¬† c) \\(14y+21x\\) ¬†¬† d) \\(15x-9x^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(6(2x+3)\\) ¬†¬† b) \\(3(3a-2)\\) ¬†¬† c) \\(7(2y+3x)\\) ¬†¬† d) \\(3x(5-3x)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.6 ‚Äì Check Your Work\nUse a quick substitution to confirm equivalence.\nExample: Is \\(5(2x-3)-(x-4)\\) the same as \\(9x-11\\)?\nExpand: \\(5(2x-3)-(x-4)=10x-15-x+4=9x-11.\\)\nCheck \\(x=2\\): \\(5(4-3)-(2-4)=5(1)-(-2)=5+2=7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 9(2)-11=18-11=7.\\) They match.\n\n\\((x+2)^2 \\neq x^2+2^2\\). Correct: \\((x+2)^2=(x+2)(x+2)=x^2+4x+4\\).",

    "text": "Absolute value\nThe distance a number is from zero on a number line, always expressed as a positive number or zero.\n\nExample:\nThe absolute value of -7 is 7.\n\n\n\n\nAddition\nAn operation that combines two or more numbers into a total.\n\nExample:\n\\(5 + 7 = 12\\)\n\n\n\n\nAlgebra\nAlgebra is a branch of math that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and relationships.\nIt lets us describe patterns, write rules, and solve problems that work in many different situations.\n\n\n\nAssociative (Associative Property)\nAn operation is associative if changing how the numbers are grouped (parentheses) doesn‚Äôt change the result‚Äîas long as the operation is the same throughout.\nWorks for:\n\nAddition: \\((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\\)\nMultiplication: \\((ab)c = a(bc)\\)\n\nDoes not work for:\n\nSubtraction: \\((a - b) - c \\ne a - (b - c)\\) in general\nDivision: \\((a \\div b) \\div c \\ne a \\div (b \\div c)\\)\nExponents: \\((a^b)^c \\ne a^{(b^c)}\\)\n\nExamples:\n\n\\((2 + 5) + 3 = 2 + (5 + 3) = 10\\)\n\\((x + 4) + 6 = x + (4 + 6) = x + 10\\)\n\\((2\\cdot 3)\\cdot x = 2\\cdot(3\\cdot x)\\)\n\nCommon gotcha: Subtraction/division aren‚Äôt associative. Also, mixing operations breaks it: \\(a + (b\\cdot c)\\) is not the same as \\((a + b)\\cdot c\\).\nWhy it matters: Lets you regroup like terms to add coefficients more easily, e.g., \\(3x + 2x + 5 = (3x + 2x) + 5 = 5x + 5\\).\nSee also: commutative, distributive property, like terms\n\n\n\nCalculate\nTo calculate is to find an answer by using numbers and operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).\n\nExample:\nTo calculate \\(7 + 5\\), we add to get 12.\n\n\n\n\nCalculus\nCalculus is a branch of math that helps us understand change and motion.\nIt‚Äôs used to study how fast things move, how things grow or shrink, and how to find exact areas or curves.\n\n\n\nCoefficient\nA coefficient is the number in front of a variable. It tells you how many of that variable you have.\n\nExample:\nIn the expression (3x), the coefficient is 3.\nIt means ‚Äú3 times x.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nComposite number\nA composite number has more than two factors.\nThat means it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.\n\nExample:\n12 is composite because 2, 3, 4, and 6 all divide it evenly.\n\n\n\n\nCompute\nTo compute is another way to say find the answer in math by doing the steps.\n\nExample:\nTo compute \\(3 \\times 4\\), we multiply to get 12.\n\n\n\n\nCommutative (Commutative Property)\nAn operation is commutative if changing the order of the numbers doesn‚Äôt change the result.\nWorks for:\n\nAddition: \\(a + b = b + a\\)\nMultiplication: \\(a\\cdot b = b\\cdot a\\)\n\nDoes not work for:\n\nSubtraction: \\(a - b \\ne b - a\\) (e.g., \\(7-3 \\ne 3-7\\))\nDivision: \\(a \\div b \\ne b \\div a\\) (e.g., \\(8\\div2 \\ne 2\\div8\\))\nExponents (in general): \\(a^b \\ne b^a\\)\n\nExamples:\n\n\\(3 + 5 = 5 + 3 = 8\\)\n\\(2x + 7 = 7 + 2x\\)\n\\(4\\cdot 3 = 3\\cdot 4 = 12\\)\n\nWhy it matters: Lets you reorder terms when simplifying, e.g., \\(2x + 5x + 3 = (2x + 5x) + 3\\).\nSee also: associative, distributive property\n\n\n\nConstant\nA constant is a number that does not change. It stays the same no matter what the variable is.\n\nExample:\nIn the expression (x + 5), the number 5 is a constant.\n\n\n\n\nConvert\nTo convert means to change a number from one form to another ‚Äî like from a fraction to a decimal, or a decimal to a percent.\n\nExample:\n\\(\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 = 75\\%\\) ‚Äî all are equivalent, just written differently.\n\n\n\n\nDecimal\nA decimal is a number that uses a dot (.) to show values less than 1. It‚Äôs based on powers of 10.\n\nExample:\n\\(0.5\\) means 5 tenths, and \\(3.14\\) means 3 and 14 hundredths.\n\n\n\n\nDenominator\nThe denominator is the bottom number in a fraction. It tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into.\n\nExample:\nIn the fraction 3/4, the denominator is 4.\n\n\n\n\nDiscount\nA discount is an amount taken off the original price. It‚Äôs usually shown as a percent.\n\nExample:\nA 25% discount on a $40 shirt means you save $10. You pay $30.\n\n\n\n\nDivision\nAn operation that splits a number into equal parts.\n\nExample:\n\\(12 \\div 3 = 4\\) (12 split into 3 equal parts)\n\n\n\n\nDivisible\nA number is divisible by another if it divides evenly ‚Äî these rules help you check quickly.\n\nDivisible by 2: The number ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 (an even number).\nDivisible by 3: The sum of the digits is divisible by 3.\nDivisible by 4: The last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\nDivisible by 5: The number ends in 0 or 5.\nDivisible by 6: The number is divisible by both 2 and 3.\nDivisible by 9: The sum of the digits is divisible by 9.\nDivisible by 10: The number ends in 0.\n\n\n\n\nDivisor\nA divisor is the number you divide by in a division problem. It tells you how many parts to split something into.\n\nExample:\nIn (12 = 4), the number 3 is the divisor because it divides 12 into 3 equal parts.\n\n\n\n\nEquation\nAn equation is a math sentence that says two things are equal.\nIt has an equals sign (=) and shows a relationship between numbers or expressions.\n\nExamples:\n\\(2 + 3 = 5\\) and \\(x + 1 = 7\\) \\((x - 5)^2 = 3x - 1\\)\n\n\n\n\nEquivalent\nTwo numbers are equivalent if they have the same value, even if they look different.\n\nExample:\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), 0.5, and 50% are all equivalent.\n\n\n\n\nEquivalent expressions\nTwo expressions are equivalent if they have the same value for every number you substitute or if they can be transformed into the same expression using properties of operations.\n\nExample:\nTake the following two expressions:\n\n\\(3x - 3\\)\n\\(3(x-1)\\)\n\nThese expressions are equivalent because, by the distributive property, expression B is \\(3x - 3\\).\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate\nTo find the value of an expression by substituting numbers for the variables and performing the calculations.\n\nExample:\nEvaluate the expression \\(2x - 5\\) when \\(x = 3\\).\n\\(2(3) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\nEven\nAn even number is any whole number that can be divided by 2 with no remainder. In other words, it ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nExample: 6 is even because $6 = 3$ with no leftover. 14, 28, and 100 are also even.\n\n\n\n\nExponent\nA number that tells you how many times to multiply a base number by itself.\n\nExample:\n\\(3^2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n\n\n\n\nExpression\nA math sentence made up of numbers, variables, operations, and sometimes parentheses ‚Äî but no equals sign.\n\nExample:\n\\(4 + 2 \\times (5 - 1)\\) is an expression.\nAnother Example:\n\\(4(x-3)^2\\) is also an expression\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nA factor is a whole number that divides another number evenly ‚Äî with no remainder.\nIf you can split something into equal groups with no leftovers, the group size is a factor.\n\nExample:\n3 is a factor of 12 because 3 √ó 4 = 12.\n\n\n\n\nFactoring\nFactoring means breaking something down into smaller parts that multiply together to make it.\n\nExamples:\n\nFactoring a number: 12 can be factored into \\(3 \\times 4\\) or \\(2 \\times 6\\).\nFactoring an expression: \\(x^2 + 5x + 6\\) can be factored into \\((x + 2)(x + 3)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor tree\nA factor tree is a way to break a number into its smallest building blocks ‚Äî the prime numbers that multiply to make it.\nYou keep splitting the number into smaller factors until you can‚Äôt go any further.\n\nExample: Here is a factor tree for 24:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n   A[24]\n   A --&gt; B[6]\n   A --&gt; C[4]\n   B --&gt; D[3]\n   B --&gt; E[2]\n   C --&gt; F[2]\n   C --&gt; G[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tells us that the prime factorization of 24 is \\(2^3 \\cdot 3\\).\n\n\n\n\nFraction\nA fraction shows a part of a whole. It has a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).\nThe denominator tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator tells how many of those parts you have.\n\nExample:\nIn 3/4, the fraction means 3 out of 4 equal parts.\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nA grade often shows how well someone did using a percent or letter. It‚Äôs usually based on part out of whole.\n\nExample:\nIf you got 18 out of 20 questions right, your grade is \\(\\frac{18}{20} = 90\\%\\).\n\n\n\n\nGreater than\nA number is greater than (&gt;) another number if it is further to the right on the number line.\n\nExample:\n\\(5 &gt; 3\\) is true  but \\(3 &gt; 5\\) is false \n\n\n\n\nGreatest Common Factor\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) is the biggest number that divides evenly into two or more numbers. It is the largest factor they have in common.\nYou can find the GCF by listing all the factors and finding the ones shared between the numbers.\n\nExample:\nThe GCF of 18 and 24 is 6, because 6 is the largest number that goes into both 18 and 24 without a remainder.\nFactors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\nFactors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\nShared factors: 1, 2, 3, 6\nThe greatest is 6\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal\nSide to side, like the horizon. Level ground is horizontal.\n\nExample:\nThis is a horizontal number line. \n\n\n\n\nHypothesis\nA hypothesis is a claim you think might be true and plan to test.\nIn an experiment, if you find a case where the hypothesis is not true you can say that it is false. If you find a case where it is true, you have evidence that the hypothesis is correct but not proof.\n\nExamples:\n‚ÄúPlants grow better when spoken to‚Äù.\n‚ÄúThese two expressions are equivalent‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\nImproper Fraction\nAn improper fraction is a fraction where the top number (numerator) is equal to or greater than the bottom number (denominator). That means the value is 1 or more.\n\nExample:\n\\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) is an improper fraction because 5 is greater than 4. It means ‚Äúfive fourths,‚Äù or \\(1\\frac{1}{4}\\) as a mixed number.\nAnother example:\n\\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) means ‚Äúeight thirds,‚Äù or \\(2\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\nInfinitely\nThe word infinitely means ‚Äúwithout end‚Äù or ‚Äúgoing on forever.‚Äù In math, something is infinite if it never stops or has no limit.\n\nExample: The number line goes on infinitely in both directions. There are infinitely many decimals between 0 and 1.\n\n\n\n\nInfinity\nInfinity is not a number ‚Äî it‚Äôs the idea of something that goes on forever without ending. In math, we use the symbol ‚àû to represent infinity.\n\nExample: The number line keeps going toward infinity in both directions. You can keep counting forever ‚Äî there‚Äôs no biggest number because numbers go on to infinity.\n\n\n\n\nInteger\nAn integer is a whole number (not a fraction or decimal) that can be positive, negative, or zero.\n\nExamples:\n-3, 0, 5, 100\n\n\n\n\nLess than\nA number is less than (&lt;) another number if it is further to the left on the number line.\n\nExample:\n\\(3 &lt; 5\\) is true  but \\(5 &lt; 3\\) is false \n\n\n\n\nLike terms\nTerms whose variable part matches exactly ‚Äî same variables with the same exponents (order doesn‚Äôt matter). You can combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients. Constants (no variables) are like terms with other constants.\n\nExamples:\n\n\\(2x\\) and \\(5x\\)\n\\(15y^2\\) and \\(-y^2\\)\n\\(5\\) and \\(-8\\)\n\nCounter Examples:\n\n\\(12x\\) and \\(15x^2\\) are not like terms.\n\\(2y\\) and \\(2x\\) are not like terms.\n\\(42\\) and \\(42z\\) are not like terms.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkup\nA markup is the amount added to a cost to set a higher selling price, usually as a percent.\n\nExample:\nIf a store buys a toy for $10 and adds a 50% markup, the price becomes $15.\n\n\n\n\nMixed Number\nA mixed number has a whole number and a fraction combined into one value.\n\nExample:\n\\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\) means 2 wholes and 1 fourth. It‚Äôs the same as \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\).\n\n\n\n\nMultiple\nA multiple is what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, and so on.\n\nExample:\n5, 10, 15, and 20 are all multiples of 5.\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication\nA math operation that means repeated addition or combining equal groups.\n\nExample:\n\\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) (4 groups of 3)\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication by proximity\nMultiplication by proximity means to multiply two things that are next to each other but with no symbol like \\(\\times\\), \\(\\cdot\\), or \\(*\\). Between them.\n\nExamples\n\n\\(3x\\)\n\\(5(x-1)\\)\n\\((2x +5)(3x-1)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber line\nA straight line used to show numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.\nNumber lines help you visualize math operations and compare values.\n\nExample:\n-2, 0, and 3 are all on the number line. \n\n\n\n\nNumber sense\nNumber sense is a person‚Äôs ability to understand, work with, and think about numbers.\nIn simple terms, it means having a good feel for how numbers work ‚Äî like knowing:\n\nWhat numbers mean\nHow they relate to each other\nHow to break them apart or put them together\nWhat a reasonable answer might be\n\nPeople with strong number sense can do mental math, estimate, recognize patterns, and spot when something ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs kind of like having a good instinct for numbers ‚Äî not just memorizing rules, but really getting how numbers behave.\n\n\n\nNumerator\nThe numerator is the top number in a fraction. It tells how many parts you have.\n\nExample:\nIn the fraction 3/4, the numerator is 3.\n\n\n\n\nNegative\nA number is negative if it is less than zero.\nOn a number line, negative numbers are to the left of zero.\n\nExample:\n-4 is a negative number.\n\n\n\n\nOdd\nAn odd number is a whole number that cannot be divided evenly by 2. It always has 1 left over. Odd numbers end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.\n\nExample: 5 is odd because $5 = 2$ with 1 left over. 11, 33, and 101 are also odd.\n\n\n\n\nOperation\nAn operation is a math action you do with numbers ‚Äî like adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing.\n\nExample:\nIn (7 + 3), the operation is addition.\nIn (12 ), the operation is division.\n\n\n\n\nOpposite\nTwo numbers that are the same distance from zero on a number line, but on opposite sides.\nTheir sum is always zero.\n\nExample:\n-3 and 3 are opposites.\n\n\n\n\nOrder of Operations\nThe specific order you follow to simplify expressions: Parentheses ‚Üí Exponents ‚Üí Multiply/Divide ‚Üí Add/Subtract, or PEMDAS.\nMultiplication and division are done left to right, whichever comes first. Same with addition and subtraction ‚Äî they are also done left to right.\n\nExample:\nIn \\(3 + 4 \\times 2\\), you multiply first: \\(3 + 8 = 11\\)\n\n\n\n\nParentheses\nA grouping symbol that tells you what to do first in an expression.\n\nExample:\nIn \\((2 + 3) \\times 4\\), you add first: \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)\n\n\n\n\nPlace Value\nPlace value tells you how much each digit is worth based on where it is in the number.\n\nExample:\nIn 23.4, the 2 is worth 20 (tens), the 3 is worth 3 (ones), and the 4 is worth 4 tenths.\n\n\n\n\nPart\nA part is one piece of the whole. It‚Äôs often what you‚Äôre looking for in a percent or fraction problem.\n\nExample:\nIn 20% of 50, the part is 10. (Because 20% of 50 is 10.)\n\n\n\n\nPEMDAS\nPEMDAS is an acronym that helps us remember the order of operations.\nP - parentheses E - exponents M - multiplication D - division A - addition S - subtraction\nSome people remember PEMDAS as ‚ÄúPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally‚Äù.\nRemember that multiplication and division are the same operation as each other and so we do them left to right. The same is true for addition and subtraction.\n\n\n\nPercent\nA percent is a way of expressing a number out of 100. The symbol % means ‚Äúper hundred.‚Äù\n\nExample:\n25% means 25 out of 100. It‚Äôs the same as \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) or 0.25.\n\n\n\n\nPositive\nA number is positive if it is greater than zero.\nOn a number line, positive numbers are to the right of zero.\n\nExample:\n5 is a positive number.\n\n\n\n\nPrime Number\nA number is prime if it has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.\n\nExamples:\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11\n\n\n\n\nPrime factorization\nPrime factorization means writing a number as a product of prime numbers.\n\nExample:\n18 = 2 √ó 3 √ó 3 or 2 √ó 3¬≤ These are the prime building blocks of 18.\n\n\n\n\nProduct\nA product is the result of multiplying two or more numbers.\n\nExample:\nThe product of 4 and 6 is 24, because 4 √ó 6 = 24.\n\n\n\n\nProportion\nA proportion shows two equal ratios. It tells you that two fractions or comparisons are the same.\n\nExample:\n\\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{6}\\) is a proportion.\n\n\n\n\nQuotient\nA quotient is the result of dividing one number by another.\n\nExample:\nThe quotient of 20 divided by 5 is 4, because 20 √∑ 5 = 4.\n\n\n\n\nRate\nA rate compares two different units, like miles per hour or cost per item.\n\nExample:\nIf you drive 60 miles in 2 hours, your rate is 30 miles per hour.\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nA ratio compares two amounts to show how much of one thing there is compared to another. You can write a ratio with words (‚Äú3 to 2‚Äù), with a colon (‚Äú3:2‚Äù), or as a fraction (\\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)).\n\nExample:\nIf there are 6 boys and 4 girls in a group, the ratio of boys to girls is 6 to 4, or 3 to 2 after simplifying.\n\n\n\n\nReal number\nA real number is any number that can be placed on the number line. This includes whole numbers (integers), fractions, and decimals. Some decimals end or repeat (like 2.75 or 0.333‚Ä¶), and some never repeat (like ‚àö2 or œÄ). All of these are real numbers.\n\nNote: There are also imaginary numbers, like ‚àö(-1), which we call i. Imaginary numbers are not on the number line. When we combine real and imaginary numbers, we get complex numbers (numbers in the form a + bi). You will hear more about these in Algebra 2!\n\n\nExample:\nReal numbers: \\(-3,\\; 0,\\; 4.5,\\; \\frac{3}{7},\\; 2.75,\\; \\sqrt{2},\\; \\pi\\)\nNot real: \\(\\sqrt{-1}=i\\), \\(5+2i\\) (complex)\n\n\n\n\nReciprocal\nThe reciprocal of a number is what you multiply it by to get 1. You can find it by flipping the numerator and denominator of a fraction.\n\nExample:\nThe reciprocal of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), because \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 1\\).\nThe reciprocal of 5 is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n\n\n\nRelatively Prime\nTwo numbers are relatively prime if they have no common factors other than 1.\nThis means their greatest common factor (GCF) is 1, even if neither number is prime.\n\nExample:\n8 and 15 are relatively prime because they share no factors except 1. 8 has factors: 1, 2, 4, 8 15 has factors: 1, 3, 5, 15\n\n\n\n\nRemainder\nA remainder is what‚Äôs left over after dividing when the number doesn‚Äôt go in evenly.\n\nExample:\n10 √∑ 3 = 3 with a remainder of 1, because 3 √ó 3 = 9 and there‚Äôs 1 left.\n\n\n\n\nResult\nThe result is the final answer you get after evaluating or simplifying an expression.\n\nExample:\nIf you evaluate \\(3x+4\\) when \\(x=2\\), the result is \\(3(2)+4=10\\).\n\n\n\n\nSimplest Form\nA fraction is in simplest form when the numerator and denominator have no common factors except 1.\nIn other words, the fraction can‚Äôt be reduced any further.\n\nExample:\n\\(\\frac{6}{8}\\) is not in simplest form because both numbers can be divided by 2. \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is the simplest form of \\(\\frac{6}{8}\\).\n\n\n\n\nSimplify\nTo simplify a number or expression means to rewrite it in a cleaner or shorter way ‚Äî without changing its value. In math, we often simplify fractions, expressions, or equations to make them easier to work with.\n\nExample:\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{12}{20}\\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4:\n\\[\\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}\\]\nThis simpler fraction means the same thing ‚Äî it‚Äôs just written with smaller numbers.\n\n\n\n\nSkip Count\nSkip counting means counting forward (or backward) by a number other than 1 ‚Äî like 2, 5, or 10. It‚Äôs a way to count faster using patterns.\n\nExample:\n\n\nSkip counting by 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ‚Ä¶\n\n\nSkip counting by 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\nSubtraction\nAn operation that finds the difference between two numbers.\n\nExample:\n\\(9 - 4 = 5\\)\n\n\n\n\nSubstitution\nSubstitution is the process of replacing a variable with a number or another expression in an equation or expression.\n\nExample:\nIf \\(x = 3\\), then substituting \\(x\\) in \\(2x + 5\\) gives \\(2(3) + 5 = 11\\).\n\n\n\n\nSurvey\nA survey is a way to collect information from people by asking questions.\n\nExample:\nA survey might ask 100 students what their favorite lunch is.\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nA symbol is a mark or character used to represent something in math.
