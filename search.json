    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.1.1 - The Number Line Is More Than Just Counting\nYou already know how to count ‚Äî 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. The number line extends that idea in both directions.\nLet‚Äôs draw a number line from -10 to 10 \nHere, every tick mark is an integer ‚Äî a whole number.\n\nNumbers to the right of zero are positive\nNumbers to the left of zero are negative\n\nWe can use this number line to see what happens when we add, subtract, or compare numbers.\nAre there other ways to draw a number line?\nYes! Number lines can be drawn over different ranges and scales. For example, here is a number line that counts form -10 to 25 in steps of 5.\n\nIn fact, number lines don‚Äôt even have to be horizontal. Here is a vertical number line that goes from 0 to 100 in steps of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can you think of any real world examples of number lines?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nthermometer\nruler\ntimeline\nAmerican football field\nvolume slider on a phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many numbers are between 3 and 5?\n\n\n\nThough there are 2 integers between 3 and 5, the answer is not 2! There are infinitely many numbers between 3 and 5. Here are some number lines that might help convince you.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 - Understanding Opposites\nLet‚Äôs look at a pair of numbers, 3 and -3.\nThese are called opposite numbers. They are the same distance from zero but on opposite sides of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† What is the opposite of zero?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposite of zero is zero. Zero is the only number that is its own opposite!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 - What Is Absolute Value?\nAbsolute value (\\(|number|\\)) measures the distance from zero, no matter the direction.\nTake a look at the number -5. The number line shows that it‚Äôs absolute value is 5 because it is 5 units away from zero. \nYou can see that |5| is also 5 for the same reason! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nAbsolute value is often used for describing the distance between two points. Suppose you live 3 miles to the east of the school and your best friend lives 5 miles to the west. How far apart are your houses? This is easy to see with a number line.\n\nYou can compute your distances by adding |-5| + |3|, by |-5 - 3|, or by |3 - (-5)|. All three of these give the same answer, 8 miles. What would change if we did not use absolute value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can the absolute value ever be negative?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute value is never negative, because distance is never negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 - Comparing Integers\nWe can also use the number line to compare values.\nLet‚Äôs compare 2 to -7. \nYou can see from the number line that 2 is greater than (&gt;) -7 because 2 is to the right of -7.\nYou can also see that -7 is further from zero than 2 and so |-7| &gt; |2|.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is bigger?\n\n\n\nIt is easy to get confused here. When we say which is ‚Äúbigger‚Äù we are asking which number is further to the right on the number line, not which one is furthest from zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Try comparing 3 to -8 using a number line.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 &gt; -8 because it is farther to the right but |-8| &gt; |3| because -8 is further from zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 - Number Lines and Arithmetic\nWe can also use the number line to model adding and subtracting integers.\n\nTo add a positive number, move right\nTo add a negative number, move left\n\nExamples:\n\nAddition: \\(-2 + 6 = 4\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nImagine that you are $2 in debt. If someone pays you $6 you can pay off the debt and have $\\(4\\) left over.\n\n\n\nAdding a negative: \\(150 + (-5) = 145\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nYou have $150 in the bank. The bank ads a fee for being under their $200 minimum balance. You now have $145.\n\n\n\nSubtraction: \\(400 - 450 = -50\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nIf you only have $400 but spend $450 on a credit card. You are now $50 in debt.\n\n\n\nSubtracting a negative: \\(201 - (-5) = 206\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can You think of a real-world example for the previous example?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: The bank made a mistake, you had $\\(201\\) in your account so they took off the $\\(5\\) fee. Now you have $\\(206\\).",

    "text": "Absolute value\nThe distance a number is from zero on a number line, always expressed as a positive number or zero.\n\nExample: The absolute value of -7 is 7.\n\n\n\n\nAlgebra\nAlgebra is a branch of math that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and relationships.\nIt lets us describe patterns, write rules, and solve problems that work in many different situations.\n\n\n\nCalculus\nCalculus is a branch of math that helps us understand change and motion.\nIt‚Äôs used to study how fast things move, how things grow or shrink, and how to find exact areas or curves.\n\n\n\nComposite number\nA composite number has more than two factors.\nThat means it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.\n\nExample: 12 is composite because 2, 3, 4, and 6 all divide it evenly.\n\n\n\n\nDenominator\nThe denominator is the bottom number in a fraction. It tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into.\n\nExample: In the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), the denominator is 4.\n\n\n\n\nEquation\nAn equation is a math sentence that says two things are equal.\nIt has an equals sign (=) and shows a relationship between numbers or expressions.\n\nExamples: 2 + 3 = 5 and x + 1 = 7\n\n\n\n\nExpression\nAn expression is a math phrase made of numbers, variables, or both ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt have an equals sign.\n\nExamples: 3x + 2 7 ‚àí y 5(a ‚àí 1)\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nA factor is a whole number that divides another number evenly ‚Äî with no remainder.\nIf you can split something into equal groups with no leftovers, the group size is a factor.\n\nExample: 3 is a factor of 12 because 3 √ó 4 = 12.\n\n\n\n\nFactoring\nFactoring means breaking something down into smaller parts that multiply together to make it.\n\nExamples:\n\nFactoring a number: 12 can be factored into 3 √ó 4 or 2 √ó 6.\nFactoring an expression: x¬≤ + 5x + 6 can be factored into (x + 2)(x + 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor tree\nA factor tree is a way to break a number into its smallest building blocks ‚Äî the prime numbers that multiply to make it.\nYou keep splitting the number into smaller factors until you can‚Äôt go any further.\n\nExample: Here is a factor tree for 24:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n   A[24]\n   A --&gt; B[6]\n   A --&gt; C[4]\n   B --&gt; D[3]\n   B --&gt; E[2]\n   C --&gt; F[2]\n   C --&gt; G[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tells us that the prime factorization of 24 is \\(2^3 \\cdot 3\\).\n\n\n\n\nFraction\nA fraction shows a part of a whole. It has a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).\nThe denominator tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator tells how many of those parts you have.\n\nExample: In \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), the fraction means 3 out of 4 equal parts.\n\n\n\n\nGreater than\nA number is greater than (&gt;) another number if it is further to the right on the number line.\n\nExample: 5 &gt; 3 is true  but 3 &gt; 5 is false \n\n\n\n\nHorizontal\nSide to side, like the horizon. Level ground is horizontal.\n\nExample: This is a horizontal number line. \n\n\n\n\nInteger\nAn integer is a whole number (not a fraction or decimal) that can be positive, negative, or zero.\n\nExamples: -3, 0, 5, 100\n\n\n\n\nLess than\nA number is less than (&lt;) another number if it is further to the left on the number line.\n\nExample: 3 &lt; 5 is true  but 5 &lt; 3 is false \n\n\n\n\nMultiple\nA multiple is what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, and so on.\n\nExample: 5, 10, 15, and 20 are all multiples of 5.\n\n\n\n\nNumber line\nA straight line used to show numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.\nNumber lines help you visualize math operations and compare values.\n\nExample: -2, 0, and 3 are all on the number line. \n\n\n\n\nNumber sense\nNumber sense is a person‚Äôs ability to understand, work with, and think about numbers.\nIn simple terms, it means having a good feel for how numbers work ‚Äî like knowing:\n\nWhat numbers mean\nHow they relate to each other\nHow to break them apart or put them together\nWhat a reasonable answer might be\n\nPeople with strong number sense can do mental math, estimate, recognize patterns, and spot when something ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs kind of like having a good instinct for numbers ‚Äî not just memorizing rules, but really getting how numbers behave.\n\n\n\nNumerator\nThe numerator is the top number in a fraction. It tells how many parts you have.\n\nExample: In the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), the numerator is 3.\n\n\n\n\nNegative\nA number is negative if it is less than zero.\nOn a number line, negative numbers are to the left of zero.\n\nExample: -4 is a negative number.\n\n\n\n\nOpposite\nTwo numbers that are the same distance from zero on a number line, but on opposite sides.\nTheir sum is always zero.\n\nExample: -3 and 3 are opposites.\n\n\n\n\nPositive\nA number is positive if it is greater than zero.\nOn a number line, positive numbers are to the right of zero.\n\nExample: 5 is a positive number.\n\n\n\n\nPrime Number\nA number is prime if it has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.\n\nExamples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11\n\n\n\n\nPrime factorization\nPrime factorization means writing a number as a product of prime numbers.\n\nExample: 18 = 2 √ó 3 √ó 3 or 2 √ó 3¬≤\n\nThese are the prime building blocks of 18.\n\n\n\nProduct\nA product is the result of multiplying two or more numbers.\n\nExample: The product of 4 and 6 is 24, because 4 √ó 6 = 24.\n\n\n\n\nQuotient\nA quotient is the result of dividing one number by another.\n\nExample: The quotient of 20 divided by 5 is 4, because 20 √∑ 5 = 4.\n\n\n\n\nRemainder\nA remainder is what‚Äôs left over after dividing when the number doesn‚Äôt go in evenly.\n\nExample: 10 √∑ 3 = 3 with a remainder of 1, because 3 √ó 3 = 9 and there‚Äôs 1 left.\n\n\n\n\nSum\nA sum is the result of adding two or more numbers.\n\nExample: The sum of 7 and 8 is 15, because 7 + 8 = 15.\n\n\n\n\nVertical\nUp and down, like a flagpole.\n\nExample: This is a vertical number line.",
