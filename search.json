    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.1.1 - The Number Line Is More Than Just Counting\nYou already know how to count ‚Äî 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. The number line extends that idea in both directions.\nLet‚Äôs draw a number line from -10 to 10 \nHere, every tick mark is an integer ‚Äî a whole number.\n\nNumbers to the right of zero are positive\nNumbers to the left of zero are negative\n\nWe can use this number line to see what happens when we add, subtract, or compare numbers.\nAre there other ways to draw a number line?\nYes! Number lines can be drawn over different ranges and scales. For example, here is a number line that counts form -10 to 25 in steps of 5.\n\nIn fact, number lines don‚Äôt even have to be horizontal. Here is a vertical number line that goes from 0 to 100 in steps of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can you think of any real world examples of number lines?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nthermometer\nruler\ntimeline\nAmerican football field\nvolume slider on a phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many numbers are between 3 and 5?\n\n\n\nThough there are 2 integers between 3 and 5, the answer is not 2! There are infinitely many numbers between 3 and 5. Here are some number lines that might help convince you.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 - Understanding Opposites\nLet‚Äôs look at a pair of numbers, 3 and -3.\nThese are called opposite numbers. They are the same distance from zero but on opposite sides of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† What is the opposite of zero?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposite of zero is zero. Zero is the only number that is its own opposite!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 - What Is Absolute Value?\nAbsolute value (\\(|number|\\)) measures the distance from zero, no matter the direction.\nTake a look at the number -5. The number line shows that it‚Äôs absolute value is 5 because it is 5 units away from zero. \nYou can see that |5| is also 5 for the same reason! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nAbsolute value is often used for describing the distance between two points. Suppose you live 3 miles to the east of the school and your best friend lives 5 miles to the west. How far apart are your houses? This is easy to see with a number line.\n\nYou can compute your distances by adding |-5| + |3|, by |-5 - 3|, or by |3 - (-5)|. All three of these give the same answer, 8 miles. What would change if we did not use absolute value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can the absolute value ever be negative?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute value is never negative, because distance is never negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 - Comparing Integers\nWe can also use the number line to compare values.\nLet‚Äôs compare 2 to -7. \nYou can see from the number line that 2 is greater than (&gt;) -7 because 2 is to the right of -7.\nYou can also see that -7 is further from zero than 2 and so |-7| &gt; |2|.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is bigger?\n\n\n\nIt is easy to get confused here. When we say which is ‚Äúbigger‚Äù we are asking which number is further to the right on the number line, not which one is furthest from zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Try comparing 3 to -8 using a number line.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 &gt; -8 because it is farther to the right but |-8| &gt; |3| because -8 is further from zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 - Number Lines and Arithmetic\nWe can also use the number line to model adding and subtracting integers.\n\nTo add a positive number, move right\nTo add a negative number, move left\n\nExamples:\n\nAddition: \\(-2 + 6 = 4\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nImagine that you are $2 in debt. If someone pays you $6 you can pay off the debt and have $\\(4\\) left over.\n\n\n\nAdding a negative: \\(150 + (-5) = 145\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nYou have $150 in the bank. The bank ads a fee for being under their $200 minimum balance. You now have $145.\n\n\n\nSubtraction: \\(400 - 450 = -50\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nIf you only have $400 but spend $450 on a credit card. You are now $50 in debt.\n\n\n\nSubtracting a negative: \\(201 - (-5) = 206\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can You think of a real-world example for the previous example?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: The bank made a mistake, you had $\\(201\\) in your account so they took off the $\\(5\\) fee. Now you have $\\(206\\).",

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.2.1 - What Are Factors?\nA factor of a number is a whole number that divides it evenly ‚Äî with no remainder.\nExample:\nThe factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 2\nThat‚Äôs because:\n1 √ó 12 = 12\n2 √ó 6 = 12\n3 √ó 4 = 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can a number have just one factor?\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one number does: 1. It only has itself as a factor and so it is neither prime nor composite!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 - What Are Multiples?\nA multiple is what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, 4‚Ä¶\nExample:\nHere are the first few multiples of 5:\n\\(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ...\\)\nMultiples are useful when finding common denominators or common multiples later in algebra.\nWhere have we seen this before?\nMultiples show up all over the place. When you skip count, you are using multiples. In the previous lesson, we used multiples to constuct number lines!\nExample:\nHere is a number line that shows multiples of three. \n\n\n\n1.2.3 - Prime vs.¬†Composite\nA prime number has only 2 factors: 1 and itself.\nExamples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13‚Ä¶\nA composite number has more than 2 factors.\nExamples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nPrime numbers play a big role in encryption, which keeps your data safe when you shop or message online.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 - Prime Factorization and Factor Trees\nEvery number can be broken into a product of prime numbers ‚Äî sort of like breaking a LEGO¬Æ sculpture into individual bricks. These prime factors are the basic building blocks of all whole numbers.\nWe use factor trees to find these prime factors. This isn‚Äôt just a fun trick ‚Äî it builds your number sense: your ability to see patterns, understand how numbers are structured, and work confidently with them.\nThat number sense will come in handy later when you:\n\nSimplify fractions\nSolve equations\nFactor algebraic expressions\nFind common denominators\n\nLet‚Äôs build a factor tree for 360 to see how it works.\n\n\nSteps to Make a Factor Tree\n\nStart with a number:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind any two numbers that multiply to give the number: \\(360 = 18 √ó 20\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak each of those numbers down further:\n\n\\(18 = 3 √ó 6\\)\n\\(20 = 4 √ó 5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep going until all branches end in prime numbers (numbers that can‚Äôt be factored anymore, like 2, 3, 5, 7‚Ä¶). We call the ends of the branches ‚Äúleaves‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prime factorization is the product of the leaves of the tree:  \\[2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 = 360\\] This can be written more compactly by using the factor counts as exponents. There are three 2s and two 3s in this case and so we get‚Ä¶ \\[2^3 * 3^2 * 5 = 360\\]\n\n\nThere are many factor trees for the number 360. For example, you could also have started with \\(360 = 3 * 120\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are still three 2s, two 3s, and one 5, so the prime factorization does not change! \\[2^3 * 3^2 * 5 = 360\\] As long as you end up with the same prime numbers, the tree is correct!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich factors should I start with?\n\n\n\nThere is no one right answer to this question. It depends on your goal. If your goal is finding easy numbers, you might start small. Notice that 360 is even that means it is divisible by 2. We could divide by 2 and keep going that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you divide by the smallest (or biggest) factors, the tree tends to become deep. If you want smaller trees, you should start with factor pairs that are closer together like we did with the first factor tree for 360, splitting first with 18 and 20.\n\n\nWhat About Negative Numbers?\nIf the number is negative, factor out a -1 first. Here is one possible factor tree for -24:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the prime factorization of -24 is‚Ä¶\n\\[-1 * 2^3 * 3 = -24\\]\nThis will come in handy later when we factor algebraic expressions like \\(-x^2 + 4x\\). It‚Äôs often helpful to pull out a negative first!\nFeeling overwhelmed?\nIf you struggle to come up with the factors for a number, you should check out the factor chart in the resources section of this book. It shows all of the factor pairs for many composite numbers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can you find at least one more factor tree for 360?\n\n\n\n\n\nI have only shown you 3 of the 60 unique factor trees for 360!",

We find the GCF by multiplying those shared factors.\n\\[2 * 2 * 3 = 12\\]\nThe GCF for 36 and 60 is 12!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Can you find the greatest common factor between 45 and 180?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth 45 and 180 share two 3s and one 5. So the GCF for 45 and 180 is:\n\\[3 * 3 * 5 = 45\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 - Using Factor Trees to Divide\nYou might have noticed that we did not circle all of the prime factors for 36 and 60. What did we leave behind and what does that mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 36 we left behind a 3 and for 60 we left behind a 5. What this means is that 36 √∑ 12 is 3 and 60 √∑ 12 is 5!‚Äù\n\nLet‚Äôs try another one\nThis time we will divide 90 by 15. Here are some factor trees to help us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number 15 has prime factors 3 and 5. We can divide 90 by 15 by crossing out those shared factors and multiplying what is left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter crossing out 3 and 5 (the factors of 15) we are left with one 3 and one 2. This gives us‚Ä¶\n\\[90 \\div 15 = 3 * 2 = 6\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Give it a try!

This is helpful when you want to simplify a fraction!\nSimplifying a fraction means rewriting it in its simplest form. This makes a fraction as ‚Äúsmall‚Äù or ‚Äúbasic‚Äù as possible without changing its value. To do that, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCF. When a fraction is in its simplest form, the numerator and denominator don‚Äôt share any factors other than 1\n\nLet‚Äôs go back to one we‚Äôve already seen:\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{60}\n\\]\nWe found earlier that the GCF of 36 and 60 is 12. So to simplify, we divide both the top and bottom by 12:\n\\[\n\\frac{36 \\div 12}{60 \\div 12} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\nThis is just like the division you saw in the factor trees. We canceled out the factors they both had ‚Äî two 2s and one 3 ‚Äî and kept what was left.\n\nHere‚Äôs another:\n\\[\n\\frac{90}{15}\n\\]\nWe know that 15 is the GCF of 90 and 15. So:\n\\[\n\\frac{90 \\div 15}{15 \\div 15} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6\n\\]\nThis tells us the fraction \\(\\frac{90}{15}\\) is just another way to write the number 6.\n\nIn other words:\n\nSimplifying a fraction is just another way of dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.\n\nFactor trees help you see why this works by breaking the numbers into their building blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the numerator and denominator don‚Äôt share any factors?\n\n\n\nIf the numerator and denominator of a fraction share no common factors (besides 1) the two numbers are called relatively prime. In this case, the fraction cannot be simplified.\nExample:\nSimplify \\(\\frac{9}{38}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 9 and 38 share no factors, \\(\\frac{9}{38}\\) is already in simplest form.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 ‚Äì Application: Simplifying with Recipes\nImagine you‚Äôre following a recipe that makes a giant batch of cookies ‚Äî way more than you need. You decide to cut the recipe down to a smaller size, but the measurements are a little awkward.\nHere‚Äôs what the recipe says:\n\n36 cups of flour\n60 cups of sugar\n\nYou don‚Äôt want to bake that much ‚Äî just a smaller, simpler version of the same cookie. But how do you shrink the recipe without changing how the cookies taste?\nLet‚Äôs treat the ingredients like a ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{36 \\text{ cups of flower}}{60 \\text{ cups sugar}}\n\\]\nThis ratio tells us how much flour to use per amount of sugar. But the numbers are too big ‚Äî and a little messy.\nJust like with fractions, we can simplify this ratio by dividing both parts by their GCF. We already know the GCF of 36 and 60 is 12.\n\\[\n\\frac{36 \\div 12}{60 \\div 12} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\nSo for every 3 cups of flour, you need 5 cups of sugar.\nNow you can make a smaller batch that keeps the same balance by finding multiples of the numerator and denominator. For example:\n\n3 cups of flour\n5 cups of sugar\n\nOr double that:\n\n6 cups of flour\n10 cups of sugar\n\nSimplifying the original recipe helped you find a cleaner ratio ‚Äî one that‚Äôs easier to scale up or down, depending on how many cookies you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüåç In the Real World\n\n\n\nSimplifying isn‚Äôt just a math trick ‚Äî it helps you work with numbers more easily in the real world. Whether you‚Äôre adjusting recipes, mixing paint, or scaling blueprints, understanding fractions and simplifying them makes life easier.",

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.4.1 ‚Äì What Are Fractions, Decimals, and Percents?\nFractions, decimals, and percents are all ways of showing a part of a whole.\nA fraction shows how many parts out of a total. We often use them when:\n\nMeasuring ingredients: ‚ÄúAdd \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of a cup of milk.‚Äù\nPosition in a ranking: ‚ÄúShe ranked 2 out of 350 or \\(\\frac{2}{350}\\).‚Äù\nSplitting or sharing something: ‚ÄúWe each got \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) of the pizza‚Äù\n\nA decimal uses place value and powers of 10. Decimals could be used for:\n\nDealing with money: ‚ÄúThis costs $4.75.‚Äù\nMeasuring length or weight: ‚ÄúThe board is 2.5 feet long.‚Äù\nReporting data or averages: ‚ÄúThe average was 3.6 stars‚Äù\n\nA percent means ‚Äúper 100‚Äù. Percents are used when:\n\nTalking about sales or discounts: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 20% off!‚Äù\nDescribing test scores: ‚ÄúShe got 95% on the quiz.‚Äù\nComparing populations or change: ‚ÄúUnemployment dropped by 2%.‚Äù\n\nWe think about and visualize fractions, decimals, and percents differently too. Here is the same number shown in three different ways!\n\n\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decimal 0.4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe percentage 40%\n\n\nYou can always use decimals, fractions, and percents interchangeably. Which one you pick often depends on the situation and so it is useful to be able to turn one type into another. The following sections show how to do just that!\n\n\n\n1.4.2 ‚Äì Converting Fractions to Decimals\nHave you ever wondered why the division symbol (√∑) looks the way it does? It has two dots separated by a bar because it represents a fraction! This is because fractions are just a different way to show division. To convert a fraction to a decimal, all we have to do is divide the numerator by the denominator.\nLet‚Äôs try:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} = 3 \\div 4 = 0.75\n\\]\nWhen we convert to a decimal, we will see that some decimals end, and some repeat forever.\n\n\n\nFraction\nDecimal\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n0.25\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n0.333‚Ä¶\n\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n0.666‚Ä¶\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n0.2\n\n\n\nIf the decimal repeats, we write a bar over the repeating part: \\(\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Out: Repeating Decimals Aren‚Äôt Always Obvious\n\n\n\nWhen you use a calculator to turn a fraction into a decimal, the result might look like it stops, but that can be misleading!\nSome fractions have repeating decimals that go on forever ‚Äî but calculators round or cut them off.\nFor example:\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) really equals \\(0.\\overline{6}\\) (0.6666‚Ä¶) but your calculator might show 0.6666666667\nThis can cause small errors if you‚Äôre not careful ‚Äî especially when comparing values or converting back to fractions.\nüëâ Tip: If the decimal looks like it‚Äôs repeating (like 0.6666666667 or 0.14285714286‚Ä¶), it probably is!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat fractions have repeating decimals?\n\n\n\nFractions with denominators that only use multiples of 2 and 5 will end. Others repeat.\nExample 1:\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) has a denominator with factors 2 and 5. It ends and gives 0.3.\nExample 2\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) has a denominator with factors 2 and 3. It repeats and gives \\(0.\\overline{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Give it a try! Write \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) as a decimal.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that‚Ä¶\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} = 2 \\div 5 = 0.4\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 - Converting Fractions and Decimals to Percents\nTurning a decimal into a percent is easy. We simply move the decimal point to the right twice (the same as multiplying by 100) and then add a % sign.\nExample: Convert 0.234 to a percent\nTo do this, we move the decimal two places to the right and then add a % sign. This gives us 23.4%.\n\nBut what if there isn‚Äôt a digit in the hundredths place? When we don‚Äôt have enough digits to the right of the decimal, we just fill them in with zeros.\nExample: Convert 0.4 to a percent.\n\nBut what if the number is bigger than 1? When the number is bigger than 1.0, we do exactly the same thing and end up with a percentage that is larger than 100%!\nExample: Convert 3.2 to a percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† What is 1.342 as a percent?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe multiply by 100 (move the decimal to the right twice) and add a % sign. This gives‚Ä¶\n\\[1.342 \\times 100 = 134.2\\%\\]\n\n\n\n\nTo convert a fraction to a percent, we first convert the fraction to a decimal.\nExample: Convert \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) to a percent.\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\Rightarrow 3 \\div 5 = 0.6\n\\]\nNow we convert the decimal to a percent.\n\\[0.6 \\Rightarrow 60\\%\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† What is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) as a percent?\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst convert to a decimal:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\Rightarrow 2 \\div 3 = 0.\\overline{6}\n\\]\nNow convert to a percent:\n\\[\n0.\\overline{6} \\Rightarrow 66.\\overline{6}\\%\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Converting Decimals to Fractions\nWhat if we want to go the other direction and convert a decimal to a fraction? The key to doing this is understanding place value.\nSuppose we have the number 123.456. The following table shows the place value for each digit.\n\n\n\nPlace\nValue\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nHundreds\n1\n1 hundred = 100\n\n\nTens\n2\n2 tens = 20\n\n\nOnes\n3\n3 ones = 3\n\n\nDecimal Point\n.\nSeparates whole from part\n\n\nTenths\n4\n4 tenths = \\(\\frac{4}{10}\\)\n\n\nHundredths\n5\n5 hundredths = \\(\\frac{5}{100}\\)\n\n\nThousandths\n6\n6 thousandths = \\(\\frac{6}{1000}\\)\n\n\n\nPlace value helps us say the number differently. Instead of saying ‚Äú123 point 456‚Äù we could say ‚Äú123 and 456 one thousandths‚Äù. This is the trick to converting decimals to fractions.\nExample 1:\nSay we want to convert 0.75 to a fraction. We could say this is ‚Äúzero point seven five‚Äù but it is more useful to say this is ‚Äú75 one hundredths‚Äù. This gives us our fraction!\n\\[\n0.75 = \\text{75 hundredths} \\Rightarrow \\frac{75}{100} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\nExample 2\nLet‚Äôs convert 0.1 into a fraction.\n\\[\n0.1 = \\text{1 tenth} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\nWhat if we have a number bigger than one?\nIf the number is bigger than one (like we saw with 4.23) we do the same thing, but we end up with a mixed number.\n\\[\n4.23 = \\text{4 and 23 hundredths} \\Rightarrow 4\\dfrac{23}{100}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Give it a try! Write 0.51 as a fraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n0.51 = \\text{51 hundredths} \\Rightarrow \\frac{51}{100}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 ‚Äì Converting Percents to Decimals and Fractions\nTo convert a percent to a decimal simply move the decimal two places left (the same as dividing by 100).\nFor example, here is what it looks like to convert 41% to a decimal. Notice that we sometimes have to add zeros to the left so the decimal has a place to go. Also notice that if there is no decimal, we put it just after the number before moving to the right.\n\nHere are some more examples:\n\n3.4% ‚Üí 0.034\n75% ‚Üí 0.75\n251% ‚Üí 2.51\n0.2% ‚Üí 0.002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† What is 35% as a decimal?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe move the decimal to the left twice and remove the % sign. This gives‚Ä¶\n\\[\n35\\% = 0.35\n\\]\n\n\n\nTo write a percent as a fraction, first convert to a decimal and then convert to a fraction, simplifying if possible:\n\n3.4% ‚Üí 0.034 ‚Üí \\(\\frac{34}{1000}\\) ‚Üí \\(\\frac{17}{500}\\)\n75% ‚Üí 0.75 ‚Üí \\(\\frac{75}{100}\\) ‚Üí \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\n251% ‚Üí 2.51 ‚Üí \\(\\frac{251}{100}\\)\n0.2% ‚Üí 0.002 ‚Üí \\(\\frac{2}{1000}\\) ‚Üí \\(\\frac{1}{500}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† What is 35% as a fraction?\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, convert to a decimal and then to a fraction.\n\\[\n35\\% = 0.35 \\Rightarrow \\text{35 hundredths} \\Rightarrow \\frac{35}{100} = \\frac{7}{20}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 ‚Äì Bringing It All Together\nNow that you‚Äôve seen how to convert between fractions, decimals, and percents, here‚Äôs a summary table to help you remember the steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom\nTo\nHow to Convert\n\n\n\n\nFraction\nDecimal\nDivide the numerator by the denominator\n\n\nFraction\nPercent\nFirst convert to a decimal then convert to a percent\n\n\nDecimal\nFraction\nUse place value (write the fraction as you would say it)\n\n\nDecimal\nPercent\nMove the decimal two places right and add % sign\n\n\nPercent\nDecimal\nMove the decimal two places left and remove % sign\n\n\nPercent\nFraction\nFirst convert to a decimal and then convert to a fraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember this!\n\n\n\nSome conversions are so common that it helps to memorize them.

    "text": "üë• Learn Together\n\n1.5.1 ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Part, Whole, or Percent?\nIn many real-world problems, you‚Äôre given some information and asked to find what‚Äôs missing. Maybe you know the total price and the discount, and you want to know how much money you saved. Or you know how many questions you got right on a quiz, and you want to figure out your percent score.\nThese types of problems usually involve three pieces:\n\npart (how much you have),\nwhole (the total or full amount),\npercent (the portion out of 100).\n\nIf you know two of them, you can figure out the third. This formula helps:\n\\[\n\\text{part} = \\text{percent} \\times \\text{whole}\n\\]\nYou can also rearrange it to solve for the percent or the whole. We‚Äôll walk through all three types of problems step by step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nConverting the percent to a decimal will make calculations easier!\n\n\n\nExample 1 ‚Äì Finding the Part\nWhat is 15% of 80?\nYou‚Äôre looking for a small part of 80 ‚Äî just 15 out of every 100. That‚Äôs what 15% means.\nWe can turn this into a math sentence by translating the words:\n\n‚Äúis‚Äù becomes =\n‚Äúof‚Äù becomes √ó\n\nSo:\n\n\n\nwhat\nis\n15%\nof\n80?\n\n\n\n\n?\n=\n\\(\\times\\)\n80\n\n\n\n\nNow solve it:\n\\[\n0.15√ó80=12\n\\]\nSo 12 is 15% of 80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Try This: What is 10% of 50?\n\n\n\n\n\n Turn it into a math sentence:\n\n\n\nwhat\nis\n10%\nof\n50?\n\n\n\n\n?\n=\n0.10\n√ó\n50\n\n\n\nThen multiply:\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 50 = 5\n\\]\nAnswer: 5\n\n\n\n\nExample 2 ‚Äì Finding the Percent\nOut of 50 students, 30 say they like soccer. What percent is that?‚Äù\nThe phrase out of tells us that 50 is the whole and 30 is the part. We can write that as a fraction, then convert it into a percent.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} = \\frac{30}{50} = 0.6 = 60\\%\n\\]\nSo 60% of students like soccer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo find a percent, divide the part by the whole, then multiply by 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Your turn: If 3 out of 100 students get enough sleep, what percent is that?\n\n\n\n\n\n \\[\n\\frac{3}{100} = 0.03 = 3\\%\n\\]\nSo only 3% of students get enough sleep!\n\n\n\n\nExample 3 ‚Äì Finding the Whole\n25% of a number is 10. What is the number?\nWe‚Äôre told that 10 is 25% of the total. That means 10 is just a piece ‚Äî one-fourth ‚Äî of the whole. (Since 25% = 1/4.)\nIf one-fourth of something is 10, then we can picture the whole as being made up of 4 equal parts of 10:\n\\[\n10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\n\\]\nSo the whole is 40.\nBut what if it‚Äôs not so easy to think in fractions like 1/4? Here‚Äôs a trick:\n25% as a decimal is 0.25. If we want to know,\n\n‚Äú0.25 of what number gives me 10?‚Äù\n\nwe can work backward by dividing:\n\\[\n10 \\div 0.25 = 40\n\\]\nSo the total is still 40 ‚Äî just another way to get the same answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Your turn: 20% of a number is 12. What is the number?\n\n\n\n\n\n Start by thinking:\n20% = 1/5 ‚Üí So if one-fifth is 12, then the whole must be:\n\\[\n12 \\times 5 = 60\n\\]\nOr use division:\n\\[\n12 \\div 0.2 = 60\n\\]\nAnswer: 60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 ‚Äì Real-Life Examples\n\nGrades\nMr.¬†Ross hands you back your Algebra quiz. You got 19 out of 20 points! What is your grade?\nGrades are given as percentages so we want to figure out what \\(\\frac{19}{20}\\) is as a percent.\n\\[\n\\frac{19}{20} = 0.95 = 95\\%\n\\]\nYou got 95% on that assignment, that‚Äôs an A!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† If John got 20 out of 25 questions correct, what is his grade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{25} = 0.8 = 80\\%\n\\]\nJohn got an 80% which is a B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales & Discounts\nA clothing store is having a back-to-school sale. A $60 jacket is on sale for 25% off. What‚Äôs the new price?  First, find the discount by asking ‚ÄúWhat is 25% of $60?‚Äù:\n\n\n\nwhat\nis\n25%\nof\n$60?\n\n\n\n\n?\n=\n0.25\n√ó\n60\n\n\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\nThis tells us we will save $15. To find the new price we subtract:\n\\[\n60 - 15 = 45\n\\]\nThe jacket now costs $45.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Swanhilda finds a $300 prom dress on sale at 65% off. What does the dress cost?\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the discount:\n\n\n\nwhat\nis\n65%\nof\n$300?\n\n\n\n\n?\n=\n0.65\n√ó\n300\n\n\n\n\\[\n0.65 \\times 300 = 195\n\\]\nNow subtract to get the sale price:\n\\[\n300 - 195 = 105\n\\]\nSwanhilda pays $105 for the dress. What a steal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveys & Data\nA survey of teachers asked whether they prefer cookies or cake. The survey found that 75% prefer cookies. If 120 of the teachers prefered cookies, how many teachers were surveyed?\nHere we want to know the whole when we have a percent. First, convert 75% to a decimal:\n\\[\n75\\% = 0.75\n\\]\nThen divide:\n\\[\n120 \\div 0.75 = 160\n\\]\n160 teachers were surveyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† A survey asked Missourians if they support Proposition A. 550 (or 55%) said they do support it. How many people were surveyed?\n\n\n\n\n\n First, convert to a decimal:\n\\[\n55\\% = 0.55\n\\]\nThen divide:\n\\[\n550 \\div 0.55 = 1000\n\\]\n1000 Missourians were surveyed.",

    "text": "Absolute value\nThe distance a number is from zero on a number line, always expressed as a positive number or zero.\n\nExample:\nThe absolute value of -7 is 7.\n\n\n\n\nAlgebra\nAlgebra is a branch of math that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and relationships.\nIt lets us describe patterns, write rules, and solve problems that work in many different situations.\n\n\n\nCalculus\nCalculus is a branch of math that helps us understand change and motion.\nIt‚Äôs used to study how fast things move, how things grow or shrink, and how to find exact areas or curves.\n\n\n\nComposite number\nA composite number has more than two factors.\nThat means it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.\n\nExample:\n12 is composite because 2, 3, 4, and 6 all divide it evenly.\n\n\n\n\nConvert\nTo convert means to change a number from one form to another ‚Äî like turning a fraction into a decimal, or a percent into a fraction. The value stays the same, but the way it‚Äôs written changes.\n\n\n\nDecimal\nA decimal is a way to show part of a whole using the base-10 system. It uses a decimal point to separate whole numbers from fractional parts.\nEach digit after the decimal point has a place value based on powers of 10:\n\nThe first place is tenths (0.1)\nThen hundredths (0.01)\nThen thousandths (0.001), and so on\n\nDecimals are closely related to fractions and can often be converted back and forth.\n\nExample:\n\n0.3 means 3 tenths, or \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\)\n0.25 means 2 tenths and 5 hundredths, or \\(\\frac{25}{100}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nDenominator\nThe denominator is the bottom number in a fraction. It tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into.\n\nExample:\nIn the fraction 3/4, the denominator is 4.\n\n\n\n\nDiscount\nA discount is a percent taken off the original price.\n\nExample:\nA 25% discount means the item costs 25% less than before.\n\n\n\n\nDivisible\nA number is divisible by another if it divides evenly ‚Äî these rules help you check quickly.\n\nDivisible by 2: The number ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 (an even number).\nDivisible by 3: The sum of the digits is divisible by 3.\nDivisible by 4: The last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\nDivisible by 5: The number ends in 0 or 5.\nDivisible by 6: The number is divisible by both 2 and 3.\nDivisible by 9: The sum of the digits is divisible by 9.\nDivisible by 10: The number ends in 0.\n\n\n\n\nEquation\nAn equation is a math sentence that says two things are equal.\nIt has an equals sign (=) and shows a relationship between numbers or expressions.\n\nExamples:\n2 + 3 = 5 and x + 1 = 7\n\n\n\n\nEquivalent\nTwo numbers, fractions, or expressions are equivalent if they have the same value, even if the look different.\n\nExample:\nThe fractions \\(\\frac{2}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{6}{12}\\) are equivalent because both simplify to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nThe decimal for \\(\\frac{2}{4}\\) can be found using a calculator by entering 1 √∑ 2, which gives 0.5\nLikewise, \\(\\frac{6}{12}\\), can be found by entering 6 √∑ 12, which also gives 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nEven\nA number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder. Numbers like 2, 4, 6, 8, ‚Ä¶ are even. Numbers that are not even are called odd numbers.\n\nExamples:\n24 √∑ 2 is 12 with no remainder, so 24 is even.\n35 √∑ 2 is 17 with a remainder of 1 so 35 is odd.\n\n\n\n\nExpression\nAn expression is a math phrase made of numbers, variables, or both ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt have an equals sign.\n\nExamples:\n\n3x + 2\n7 ‚àí y\n5(a ‚àí 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nA factor is a whole number that divides another number evenly ‚Äî with no remainder.\nIf you can split something into equal groups with no leftovers, the group size is a factor.\n\nExample:\n3 is a factor of 12 because 3 √ó 4 = 12.\n\n\n\n\nFactoring\nFactoring means breaking something down into smaller parts that multiply together to make it.\n\nExamples:\n\nFactoring a number: 12 can be factored into 3 √ó 4 or 2 √ó 6.\nFactoring an expression: x¬≤ + 5x + 6 can be factored into (x + 2)(x + 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor tree\nA factor tree is a way to break a number into its smallest building blocks ‚Äî the prime numbers that multiply to make it.\nYou keep splitting the number into smaller factors until you can‚Äôt go any further.\n\nExample:\nHere is a factor tree for 24:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tells us that the prime factorization of 24 is \\(2^3 \\cdot 3\\).\n\n\n\n\nFraction\nA fraction shows a part of a whole. It has a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).\nThe denominator tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator tells how many of those parts you have.\n\nExample:\nIn 3/4, the fraction means 3 out of 4 equal parts.\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nA grade is a way to show how well someone did on a task, often written as a percent.\n\nExample:\nIf you get 18 out of 20 points, your grade is \\(18 \\div 20 * 100 = 90\\%\\).\n\n\n\n\nGreater than\nA number is greater than (&gt;) another number if it is further to the right on the number line.\n\nExample:\n5 &gt; 3 is true  but 3 &gt; 5 is false \n\n\n\n\nGreatest Common Factor\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) is the biggest number that divides evenly into two or more numbers. It is the largest factor they have in common.\nYou can find the GCF by listing all the factors and finding the ones shared between the numbers.\n\nExample:\nThe GCF of 18 and 24 is 6, because 6 is the largest number that goes into both 18 and 24 without a remainder.\nFactors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\nFactors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\nShared factors: 1, 2, 3, 6\nThe greatest is 6\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal\nSide to side, like the horizon. Level ground is horizontal.\n\nExample:\nThis is a horizontal number line. \n\n\n\n\nInteger\nAn integer is a whole number (not a fraction or decimal) that can be positive, negative, or zero.\n\nExample:\n-3, 0, 5, and 100 are all integers.\n\n\n\n\nLess than\nA number is less than (&lt;) another number if it is further to the left on the number line.\n\nExample:\n3 &lt; 5 is true  but 5 &lt; 3 is false \n\n\n\n\nMarkup\nMarkup is a percent added to the cost of something to set the selling price. Businesses use markup to make a profit.\n\nExample:\nA store buys a backpack for $20. They want to make money, so they add a 50% markup.\nTo find the markup amount:\n\\[\\text{Markup} = 0.5 \\times 20 = 10\\]\nThen add it to the cost:\n\\[\\text{Selling¬†Price} = 20 + 10 = 30\\]\nSo the store sells the backpack for $30.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple\nA multiple is what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, and so on.\n\nExample:\n5, 10, 15, and 20 are all multiples of 5.\n\n\n\n\nNegative\nA number is negative if it is less than zero.\nOn a number line, negative numbers are to the left of zero.\n\nExample:\n-4 is a negative number.\n\n\n\n\nNumber line\nA straight line used to show numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.\nNumber lines help you visualize math operations and compare values.\n\nExample:\n-2, 0, and 3 are all on the number line. \n\n\n\n\nNumber sense\nNumber sense is a person‚Äôs ability to understand, work with, and think about numbers.\nIn simple terms, it means having a good feel for how numbers work ‚Äî like knowing:\n\nWhat numbers mean\nHow they relate to each other\nHow to break them apart or put them together\nWhat a reasonable answer might be\n\nPeople with strong number sense can do mental math, estimate, recognize patterns, and spot when something ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs kind of like having a good instinct for numbers ‚Äî not just memorizing rules, but really getting how numbers behave.\n\n\n\nNumerator\nThe numerator is the top number in a fraction. It tells how many parts you have.\n\nExample:\nIn the fraction 3/4, the numerator is 3.\n\n\n\n\nOdd\nA number is odd if dividing it by 2 leaves a remainder. Numbers like 3, 5, 7, 9, ‚Ä¶ are odd numbers. Numbers that are not odd are called even numbers.\n\nExamples:\n35 √∑ 2 is 17 with a remainder of 1 so 35 is odd.\n24 √∑ 2 is 12 with no remainder, so 24 is even.\n\n\n\n\nOpposite\nTwo numbers that are the same distance from zero on a number line, but on opposite sides.\nTheir sum is always zero.\n\nExample:\n-3 and 3 are opposites.\n\n\n\n\nPart\nThe part is the piece or portion of the total amount.\n\nExample:\nIf 3 out of 5 students like pizza, the part is 3.\n\n\n\n\nPercent\nA percent is a number out of 100. It uses the percent symbol (%) and is another way to show part of a whole.\n\nExample:\n25% means 25 out of 100 parts.\n\n\n\n\nPlace Value\nPlace value tells you what each digit in a number means, based on its position. In a decimal like 0.4, the 4 is in the tenths place ‚Äî it means 4 tenths. Each place to the right is worth ten times less than the one before it.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive\nA number is positive if it is greater than zero.\nOn a number line, positive numbers are to the right of zero.\n\nExample:\n5 is a positive number.\n\n\n\n\nPrime Number\nA number is prime if it has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.\n\nExample:\n2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are all prime numbers.\n\n\n\n\nPrime factorization\nPrime factorization means writing a number as a product of prime numbers.\n\nExample:\n18 = 2 √ó 3 √ó 3 or 2 √ó 3¬≤\n\nThese are the prime building blocks of 18.\n\n\n\nProduct\nA product is the result of multiplying two or more numbers.\n\nExample:\nThe product of 4 and 6 is 24, because 4 √ó 6 = 24.\n\n\n\n\nProportion\nA proportion is a statement that two ratios or fractions are equal.\n\nExample:\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{4}\\) is a true proportion.\n\n\n\n\nQuotient\nA quotient is the result of dividing one number by another.\n\nExample:\nThe quotient of 20 divided by 5 is 4, because 20 √∑ 5 = 4.\n\n\n\n\nRate\nA rate compares two different types of quantities. It often uses the word per like in miles per hour or price per gallon.\n\nExample:\nAnne used 10 gallons of gas to drive 500 miles in her Prius Her gas mileage was $ 500 = 50 $\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nA ratio compares two amounts or quantities, showing how much there is of one thing compared to another. It tells us about the relationship between the numbers.\nThere are three common ways to write a ratio:\n\nUsing a colon (like 2:3)\nAs a fraction (like \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\))\nUsing the word ‚Äúto‚Äù (like 2 to 3)\n\n\nExample:\nIf you have 4 red balloons and 6 blue balloons: The ratio of red balloons to blue balloons is 4:6 or 2:3 (when simplified). This means for every 2 red balloons, there are 3 blue balloons.\n\n\n\n\nRelatively prime\nTwo numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common factor is 1. That means they don‚Äôt share any factors other than 1 - even if neither number is prime.\n\nExample:\n8 and 15 are relatively prime because the only number that evenly divides both is 1.\n\n\n\n\nRemainder\nA remainder is what‚Äôs left over after dividing when the number doesn‚Äôt go in evenly.\n\nExample:\n10 √∑ 3 = 3 with a remainder of 1, because 3 √ó 3 = 9 and there‚Äôs 1 left.\n\n\n\n\nSimplest form\nA fraction is in simplest form (or lowest terms) when you cannot divide the top number (numerator) and the bottom number (denominator) by an common factor other than 1.\nWe write fractions in simplest form to make the numbers as ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and easy to understand as possible without changing the value.\n\nExample:\n\\(\\frac{4}{8}\\) is not in simplest form because both 4 and 8 can be divided by 4.\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is in simplest form because the only common factor for 1 and 2 is 1.\n\n\n\n\nSimplify\nTo simplify a number or expression means to rewrite it in a cleaner or shorter way ‚Äî without changing its value. In math, we often simplify fractions, expressions, or equations to make them easier to work with.\n\nExample:\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{12}{20}\\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4:\n\\[\\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}\\]\nThis simpler fraction means the same thing ‚Äî it‚Äôs just written with smaller numbers.\n\n\n\n\nSum\nA sum is the result of adding two or more numbers.\n\nExample:\nThe sum of 7 and 8 is 15, because 7 + 8 = 15.\n\n\n\n\nSurvey\nA survey is a way to gather information by asking people questions. Surveys often report results using percents.\n\nExample:\nMr.¬†Ross‚Äô gave a survey to his Algebra class that asked whether they like pineapple pizza. Of the 18 people in class, only 4 responded that the liked pineapple pizza. Mr.¬†Ross reported that \\(22.\\overline{2}\\%\\) like pineapple on their pizza.\n\n\n\n\nVertical\nUp and down, like a flagpole.\n\nExample:\nThis is a vertical number line. \n\n\n\n\nWhole\nThe whole is the total amount. It‚Äôs the full quantity before being divided into parts.\n\nExample:\nIf someone eats 3 slices of a pizza cut into 8 slices, they ate \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) of the whole pizza.",
