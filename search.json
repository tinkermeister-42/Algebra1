Even advanced topics like algebra and calculus are just clever ways of organizing and extending basic ideas — like moving forward and backward on a number line.\nIn this lesson, we’ll use the number line not just to count, but to add, subtract, and compare positive and negative numbers. That might sound basic, but it’s the foundation of nearly everything else you’ll do in Algebra.\nNegative numbers can be tricky, especially when the rules don’t always match what your gut tells you. But if you can master the way they work on the number line — including things like opposites, absolute value, and comparison — you’ll be setting yourself up for success in the rest of the course.\nAnswer as best you can – even if you aren’t sure!",

    "text": "👥 Learn Together\n\n1.1.1 The Number Line Is More Than Just Counting\nYou already know how to count — \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and so on. The number line extends that idea in both directions.\nLet’s draw a number line from \\(-10\\) to \\(10\\) \nHere, every tick mark is an integer — a whole number.\n\nNumbers to the right of zero are positive\nNumbers to the left of zero are negative\n\nWe can use this number line to see what happens when we add, subtract, or compare numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 How many numbers are between \\(3\\) and \\(5\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is not \\(2\\)! There are infinitely many numbers between \\(3\\) and \\(5\\). Here are two number lines that might help convince you.\nComming soon!  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Understanding Opposites\nLet’s look at a pair of numbers, \\(3\\) and \\(-3\\).\nThese are called opposite numbers. They are the same distance from zero but on opposite sides of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 What is the opposite of zero?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposite of zero is zero. Zero is the only number that is its own opposite!\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 What Is Absolute Value?\nAbsolute value (\\(|x|\\)) measures the distance from zero, no matter the direction.\nTake a look at the number \\(-5\\). The number line shows that it’s absolute value is \\(5\\) because it is \\(5\\) units away from zero. \nYou can see that \\(|5|\\) is also \\(5\\) for the same reason! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 Can the absolute value ever be negative?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute value is never negative, because distance is never negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Comparing Integers\nWe can also use the number line to compare values.\nLet’s compare \\(2\\) to \\(-7\\). \nAsk yourself:\n\nWhich number is farther to the right?\nWhich number is closer to 0?\nDoes absolute value change the comparison?\n\nYou can see from the number line that \\(2 &gt; -7\\) because \\(2\\) is to the right of \\(-7\\). But \\(|-7|&gt;|2|\\), that is \\(-7\\) has a greater absolute value than \\(2\\) because \\(-7\\) is further from zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 Try comparing \\(3\\) to \\(-8\\) using a number line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(3 &gt; -8\\) because it is further to the right but \\(|-8|&gt;|3|\\) because \\(-8\\) is further from zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Number Lines and Arithmetic\nWe can also use the number line to model adding and subtracting integers.\n\nTo add a positive number, move right\nTo add a negative number, move left\n\nExamples:\n\nAddition: \\(-2 + 6 = 4\\) \nSubtraction: \\(4 - 7 = -3\\) \nAdding a negative: \\(2 + (-5) = -3\\) \nSubtracting a negative: \\(2 - (-3) = 5\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 Can You think of a real-world example of each of these?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are $\\(2\\) in debt and earn $\\(6\\), now you have $\\(4\\).\nYou have $\\(4\\) and spend $\\(7\\). You are now $\\(3\\) in debt.\nYou have $\\(2\\), the bank adds a $\\(5\\) fee to your account. You now owe $\\(3\\).\nYou have $\\(2\\), the bank forgives a $\\(3\\) overdraft fee. You now have $\\(5\\).",
