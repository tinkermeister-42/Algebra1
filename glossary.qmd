---

### Greatest Common Factor {#glossary-greatest-common-factor}

The **greatest common factor** (GCF) is the biggest number that divides evenly into two or more numbers. It is the largest factor they have in common. 

You can find the GCF by listing all the factors and finding the ones shared between the numbers.

> **Example:**
>
> The GCF of 18 and 24 is 6, because 6 is the largest number that goes into both 18 and 24 without a remainder.
>
> Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
>
> Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
>

> **Example:**
> The number line goes on **infinitely** in both directions.
> There are **infinitely many** decimals between 0 and 1.

---

### Infinity {#glossary-infinity}

**Infinity** is not a number — it’s the idea of something that goes on forever without ending. In math, we use the symbol ∞ to represent infinity.

> **Example:**
> The number line keeps going toward **infinity** in both directions.
> You can keep counting forever — there's no biggest number because numbers go on to **infinity**.

---

### Integer {#glossary-integer}

### Number sense {#glossary-number-sense}

**Number sense** is a person’s ability to understand, work with, and think about numbers.

In simple terms, it means having a good feel for how numbers work — like knowing:

* What numbers mean
* How they relate to each other
* How to break them apart or put them together
* What a reasonable answer might be

People with strong number sense can do mental math, estimate, recognize patterns, and spot when something “doesn’t make sense.”

It's kind of like having a good instinct for numbers — not just memorizing rules, but really *getting* how numbers behave.

---

### Numerator {#glossary-numerator}

The numerator is the **top number** in a fraction. It tells **how many parts** you have.

> **Example:**
>
> In the fraction 3/4, the **numerator** is 3.

---

### Odd {#glossary-odd}

An **odd number** is a whole number that **cannot** be divided evenly by 2. It always has 1 left over. Odd numbers end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.

> **Example:**
> 5 is odd because \$5 \div 2 = 2\$ with 1 left over.
> 11, 33, and 101 are also odd.

---

### Remainder {#glossary-remainder}

A remainder is what’s left over after dividing when the number doesn’t go in evenly.

> `10 ÷ 3 = 3` with a remainder of `1`, because `3 × 3 = 9` and there’s `1` left.

---

### Simplest Form {#glossary-simplest-form}

A fraction is in simplest form when the numerator and denominator have **no common factors** except 1.

In other words, the fraction can’t be reduced any further.

> **Example:**
>
> $\frac{6}{8}$ is not in simplest form because both numbers can be divided by 2.
> $\frac{3}{4}$ is the simplest form of $\frac{6}{8}$.

---

### Simplify {#glossary-simplify}

To **simplify** a number or expression means to **rewrite it in a cleaner or shorter way** — without changing its value. In math, we often simplify fractions, expressions, or equations to make them easier to work with.

> **Example:**
>
> The fraction $\frac{12}{20}$ can be simplified by dividing both the {{< glink numerator >}} and {{< glink denominator >}} by 4:

---

### Whole number {#glossary-whole-number}

A **whole number** is a number with **no fractions or decimals**. These are **0, 1, 2, 3, …** (zero and the positive integers). Whole numbers do **not** include negatives, decimals, or fractions. They are a subset of **integers**.

**Note:** Some books use “natural numbers” to mean 1, 2, 3, … (sometimes including 0, sometimes not). “Whole numbers” always include **0**.
