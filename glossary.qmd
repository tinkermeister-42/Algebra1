### Algebra {#glossary-algebra}

Algebra is a branch of math that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and relationships.

It lets us describe patterns, write rules, and solve problems that work in many different situations.

---

### Calculus {#glossary-calculus}

Calculus is a branch of math that helps us understand change and motion.

It’s used to study how fast things move, how things grow or shrink, and how to find exact areas or curves.

---

### Composite number {#glossary-composite-number}

A composite number has more than two factors.

That means it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.

> Example: 12 is composite because 2, 3, 4, and 6 all divide it evenly.

---

### Denominator {#glossary-denominator}

The denominator is the **bottom number** in a fraction. It tells **how many equal parts** the whole is divided into.

> Example: In the fraction 3/4, the **denominator** is 4.

---

### Divisible {#glossary-divisible}

A number is **divisible** by another if it divides evenly — these rules help you check quickly.

* **Divisible by 2**: The number ends in **0, 2, 4, 6, or 8** (an even number).
* **Divisible by 3**: The **sum of the digits** is divisible by 3.
* **Divisible by 4**: The **last two digits** form a number divisible by 4.
* **Divisible by 5**: The number ends in **0 or 5**.
* **Divisible by 6**: The number is divisible by **both 2 and 3**.
* **Divisible by 9**: The **sum of the digits** is divisible by 9.
* **Divisible by 10**: The number ends in **0**.

### Equation {#glossary-equation}

An equation is a math sentence that says two things are equal.

It has an equals sign (=) and shows a relationship between numbers or expressions.

> Examples: `2 + 3 = 5` and `x + 1 = 7`

---

### Equivalent {#glossary-equivalent}

Two numbers, fractions, or expressions are **equivalent** if they have the **same value**, even if the look different.


> **Example:**
>
> The fractions $\frac{2}{4}$ and $\frac{6}{12}$ are equivalent because both simplify to $\frac{1}{2}$. 
>
> The decimal for $\frac{2}{4}$ can be found using a calculator by entering 1 &divide; 2, which gives 0.5  
>
>Likewise, $\frac{6}{12}$, can be found by entering 6 &divide; 12, which also gives 0.5.

---

### Expression {#glossary-expression}

An expression is a math phrase made of numbers, variables, or both — but it doesn’t have an equals sign.

> Examples:
> `3x + 2`
> `7 − y`
> `5(a − 1)`

---

### Factor {#glossary-factor}

A factor is a whole number that divides another number evenly — with no remainder.

If you can split something into equal groups with no leftovers, the group size is a factor.

> Example: 3 is a factor of 12 because 3 × 4 = 12.

---

### Factoring {#glossary-factoring}

Factoring means breaking something down into smaller parts that multiply together to make it.

> Examples:
> 
> - Factoring a number: 12 can be factored into `3 × 4` or `2 × 6`.
>
> - Factoring an expression: `x² + 5x + 6` can be factored into `(x + 2)(x + 3)`.

---

### Factor tree {#glossary-factor-tree}

A factor tree is a way to break a number into its smallest building blocks — the prime numbers that multiply to make it.

You keep splitting the number into smaller factors until you can’t go any further.

> Example: Here is a factor tree for 24:
>
```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
   A[24]
   A --> B[6]
   A --> C[4]
   B --> D[3]
   B --> E[2]
   C --> F[2]
   C --> G[2]
```
>
> This tells us that the {{< glink prime factorization >}} of 24 is $2^3 \cdot 3$.

---

### Fraction {#glossary-fraction}

A fraction shows a part of a whole. It has a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).

The denominator tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator tells how many of those parts you have.

> Example: In 3/4, the fraction means **3 out of 4** equal parts.

---

### Greater than {#glossary-greater-than}

A number is greater than (**>**) another number if it is further to the right on the number line.

> Example: `5 > 3` is true
> ![Greater than true](images/Glossary/greater_than_true.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}
> but `3 > 5` is false
> ![Greater than false](images/Glossary/greater_than_false.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}

---

### Greatest Common Factor {#glossary-greatest-common-factor}

The **greatest common factor** (GCF) is the biggest number that divides evenly into two or more numbers. It is the largest factor they have in common. 

You can find the GCF by listing all the factors and finding the ones shared between the numbers.

> **Example:**
>
> The GCF of 18 and 24 is 6, because 6 is the largest number that goes into both 18 and 24 without a remainder.
>
> Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
>
> Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
>
> Shared factors: 1, 2, 3, 6
> 
> **The greatest is 6**

---

### Horizontal {#glossary-horizontal}

Side to side, like the horizon. Level ground is horizontal.

> **Example:**
>
>  This is a horizontal number line.
> ![](/images/Glossary/blank_numberline.png)

---

### Improper Fraction {#glossary-improper-fraction}

An improper fraction is a fraction where the top number (numerator) is equal to or greater than the bottom number (denominator). That means the value is 1 or more.

> **Example:**
>
> $\frac{5}{4}$ is an improper fraction because 5 is greater than 4.
> It means “five fourths,” or $1\frac{1}{4}$ as a mixed number.
>
> **Another example:**
>
> $\frac{8}{3}$ means “eight thirds,” or $2\frac{2}{3}$.

---

### Integer {#glossary-integer}

An integer is a whole number (not a fraction or decimal) that can be positive, negative, or zero.

> **Examples:** `-3`, `0`, `5`, `100`

---

### Less than {#glossary-less-than}

A number is less than (**<**) another number if it is further to the left on the number line.

> Example: `3 < 5` is true
> ![Less than true](images/Glossary/less_than_true.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}
> but `5 < 3` is false
> ![Less than false](images/Glossary/less_than_false.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}

---

### Multiple {#glossary-multiple}

A multiple is what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, and so on.

> Example: `5`, `10`, `15`, and `20` are all multiples of `5`.

---

### Number line {#glossary-number-line}

A straight line used to show numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.

Number lines help you visualize math operations and compare values.

> Example: `-2`, `0`, and `3` are all on the number line.
> ![Number line](images/Glossary/number_line_example.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}

---

### Number sense {#glossary-number-sense}

**Number sense** is a person’s ability to understand, work with, and think about numbers.

In simple terms, it means having a good feel for how numbers work — like knowing:

* What numbers mean
* How they relate to each other
* How to break them apart or put them together
* What a reasonable answer might be

People with strong number sense can do mental math, estimate, recognize patterns, and spot when something “doesn’t make sense.”

It's kind of like having a good instinct for numbers — not just memorizing rules, but really *getting* how numbers behave.

---

### Numerator {#glossary-numerator}

The numerator is the **top number** in a fraction. It tells **how many parts** you have.

> Example: In the fraction 3/4, the **numerator** is 3.

---

### Negative {#glossary-negative}

A number is negative if it is less than zero.

On a number line, negative numbers are to the left of zero.

> Example: `-4` is a negative number.

---

### Opposite {#glossary-opposite}

Two numbers that are the same distance from zero on a number line, but on opposite sides.

Their sum is always zero.

> Example: `-3` and `3` are opposites.

---

### Positive {#glossary-positive}

A number is positive if it is greater than zero.

On a number line, positive numbers are to the right of zero.

> Example: `5` is a positive number.

---

### Prime Number {#glossary-prime-number}

A number is prime if it has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.

> Examples: `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`

---

### Prime factorization {#glossary-prime-factorization}

Prime factorization means writing a number as a product of prime numbers.

> Example: `18 = 2 × 3 × 3` or `2 × 3²`

These are the prime building blocks of 18.

---

### Product {#glossary-product}

A product is the **result of multiplying** two or more numbers.

> Example: The product of 4 and 6 is `24`, because `4 × 6 = 24`.

---

### Quotient {#glossary-quotient}

A quotient is the **result of dividing** one number by another.

> Example: The quotient of 20 divided by 5 is `4`, because `20 ÷ 5 = 4`.

---

### Remainder {#glossary-remainder}

A remainder is what’s left over after dividing when the number doesn’t go in evenly.

> Example: `10 ÷ 3 = 3` with a remainder of `1`, because `3 × 3 = 9` and there’s `1` left.

---

### Simplify {#glossary-simplify}

To **simplify** a number or expression means to **rewrite it in a cleaner or shorter way** — without changing its value. In math, we often simplify fractions, expressions, or equations to make them easier to work with.

> **Example:**
> The fraction $\frac{12}{20}$ can be simplified by dividing both the {{< glink numerator >}} and {{< glink denominator >}} by 4:
> 
> $$\frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5}$$
>
> This simpler fraction means the same thing — it's just written with smaller numbers.


---

### Sum {#glossary-sum}

A sum is the **result of adding** two or more numbers.

> Example: The sum of 7 and 8 is `15`, because `7 + 8 = 15`.
