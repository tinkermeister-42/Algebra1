# 2.2 ‚Äì Evaluating Expressions {.unnumbered}

Once we know how to write algebraic expressions, the next step is to **evaluate** them. That means plugging in a number for each variable and simplifying the result. This is like testing what an expression equals when we know the value of the variable.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll practice **substituting** values into expressions and using **order of operations** (PEMDAS) to simplify. You‚Äôll also start seeing how some expressions are always equal ‚Äî even if they look different at first.

1. What do you get if you simplify this expression?  
   \[
   3 + 2 \cdot 4
   \]  
   Why do we multiply before adding?

2. A student says \(2x + 5\) and \(5 + 2x\) are different. Do you agree? Why or why not?

3. What happens when you square a negative number, like \((-3)^2\)? What if you forget the parentheses?

> These questions build on Unit 1 thinking and help students prepare to handle substitution and order of operations correctly ‚Äî especially with negatives and parentheses.

### 2.2.1 ‚Äì What Does It Mean to Evaluate?

To **evaluate** an expression means to find its value by **substituting** a number for the variable.

> **Example:**
>
> \[
> 4x + 1 \text{ when } x = 3
> \]
> \[
> = 4 \cdot 3 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13
> \]

> _Tip: Always put parentheses around the number you substitute ‚Äî especially if it‚Äôs negative!_

### 2.2.2 ‚Äì Using PEMDAS with Substitution

You still follow the same **order of operations**:

**P**arentheses ‚Üí **E**xponents ‚Üí **M/D** ‚Üí **A/S**

> **Example:**
>
> \[
> 2(x + 3)^2 \text{ when } x = 1
> \]
> \[
> = 2(1 + 3)^2 = 2(4)^2 = 2 \cdot 16 = 32
> \]

> _Common mistake: Forgetting to square the whole quantity inside parentheses._

Evaluate each expression.

1. \(3x + 5\) when \(x = 4\)  
2. \((x - 2)^2\) when \(x = 5\)  
3. \(2x - 4y\) when \(x = 3,\ y = 1\)  
4. \(\frac{x + 6}{2}\) when \(x = 8\)  
:::

### 2.2.3 ‚Äì Why Parentheses Matter

Let‚Äôs look at this expression:

\[
-3^2 \quad \text{vs.} \quad (-3)^2
\]

- \(-3^2 = -(3^2) = -9\)  
- \((-3)^2 = (-3) \cdot (-3) = 9\)

> _Tip: Without parentheses, the negative sign applies **after** squaring._

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="üí• Parentheses Practice"}
Evaluate carefully:

1. \(-4^2\)  
2. \((-4)^2\)  
3. \((x - 1)^2\) when \(x = 6\)  
4. \(-x^2 + 2x\) when \(x = 3\)
:::

---

### 2.2.4 ‚Äì Equivalent Expressions

Sometimes two expressions look different but always give the same result.

> **Example:**
>
> \[
> 3x + 2x = 5x
> \]
> Even if you substitute any value for \(x\), both expressions give the same result. Try it!

> **Try it:**
>
> \[
> 3x + 2x \quad \text{vs.} \quad 5x \text{ when } x = 4
> \]
> \[
> = 12 + 8 = 20 \quad \text{vs.} \quad 5 \cdot 4 = 20
> \]

These are called **equivalent expressions** ‚Äî they look different but are always equal.

> _Visual idea: Use an input-output table comparing expressions side by side._

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="üí≠ Are These Equivalent?"}
Try evaluating both expressions when \(x = 2\), \(x = 5\), and \(x = 10\). Are they always the same?

1. \(2x + 3x\) and \(5x\)  
2. \(3(x + 4)\) and \(3x + 12\)  
3. \(x^2 + 4\) and \((x + 2)^2\)  
4. \(2(x + 3) - 1\) and \(2x + 5\)

Which are equivalent? How do you know?

## üèãÔ∏è Practice On Your Own

Evaluate each expression by substituting the given value(s).

1. \(2x + 5\) when \(x = 6\)  
2. \(x^2 + 3x\) when \(x = 4\)  
3. \((x - 2)^2\) when \(x = 1\)  
4. \(2a - 3b\) when \(a = 3, b = 5\)  
5. \(\frac{x + 10}{5}\) when \(x = 15\)  
6. \(-x^2 + 4x - 1\) when \(x = 2\)  

Decide whether each pair is equivalent. Use substitution to test values.

7. \(4x + 2x\) and \(6x\)  
8. \(2(x + 3)\) and \(2x + 6\)  
9. \(x^2 + 2x + 1\) and \((x + 1)^2\)  
10. \(5x - 3\) and \(3x + 5\)
