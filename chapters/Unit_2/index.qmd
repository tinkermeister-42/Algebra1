# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Unit 2! This unit is all about using **variables** and **expressions** to represent patterns, describe relationships, and build the foundation for equations.

You’ll learn how to write algebraic expressions, simplify them, evaluate them using substitution, and understand when two expressions are really saying the same thing — even if they look different.

This unit also introduces the key idea behind **functions**: that one input leads to one output. No graphing yet — just solid building blocks to prepare for what's ahead.

## What You’ll Learn

By the end of this unit, you’ll be able to:

- Identify parts of an expression and describe their meaning  
- Write and evaluate expressions using variables and the order of operations  
- Combine like terms and use the distributive property to simplify expressions  
- Understand how inputs and rules connect to outputs — and what makes something a function  
- Tell whether two expressions are equivalent using simplification and substitution

## Topics in This Unit

[**Expressions & Their Parts**](2.1_Expressions_and_their_parts.html)  
Learn what algebraic expressions are made of — variables, terms, constants, and coefficients — and how to describe real-world situations with math.

[**Evaluating Expressions**](2.2_Evaluating_expressions.html)  
Plug in values for variables and simplify expressions using the correct order of operations (PEMDAS). Learn why parentheses matter!

[**Combining Like Terms**](2.3_Combining_like_terms.html)  
Identify and combine terms that have the same variable part. Simplify expressions and see why combining like terms works.

[**The Distributive Property**](2.4_The_distributive_property.html)  
Use multiplication to “distribute” across parentheses. Learn how this helps simplify expressions and spot equivalent forms.

[**Inputs, Outputs & Functions**](2.5_Inputs_outputs_and_functions.html)  
Explore how rules turn inputs into outputs. Learn what makes something a function and how to represent it with tables and expressions.

[**Equivalent Expressions**](2.6_Equivalent_expressions.html)  
Discover how different-looking expressions can mean the same thing. Use simplification and substitution to test for equivalence.
