# 2.4 ‚Äì The Distributive Property {.unnumbered}

Sometimes expressions have parentheses. To simplify them, we often use the **distributive property**. This means multiplying what's **outside** the parentheses by everything **inside**.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to apply the distributive property, understand *why* it works, and use it to simplify expressions. You'll also see how different-looking expressions can be equivalent by distributing or factoring.

1. You buy 3 bags of snacks. Each bag has 2 chips, 1 candy, and 1 drink.  
   - How could you find the total number of snacks without opening the bags?

2. What is the value of \(2(4 + 3)\)?  
   What do you notice if you rewrite it as \(2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 3\)?

3. Write two different-looking expressions that both equal 12. How do you know they‚Äôre equal?

### 2.4.1 ‚Äì What Is the Distributive Property?

The **distributive property** lets you multiply a number by a group in parentheses:

\[
a(b + c) = ab + ac
\]

> **Example:**
> \[
> 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12
> \]

You multiply the **3** by **both** terms inside:  
- \(3 \cdot x = 3x\)  
- \(3 \cdot 4 = 12\)

> _Visual note: Use an area model or rectangle diagram to show this. Label one side as 3 and the other as split into \(x\) and 4._

---

### 2.4.2 ‚Äì Why It Works

Think of the parentheses as a **group**. You have 3 copies of the group \((x + 4)\):

\[
(x + 4) + (x + 4) + (x + 4)
\]

If you combine like terms:  
\[
3x + 12
\]

It‚Äôs the same as multiplying once:  
\[
3(x + 4)
\]

So these are **equivalent expressions**.

Use the distributive property to expand each expression.

1. \(2(x + 3)\)  
2. \(5(a - 2)\)  
3. \(3(2x + 4)\)  
4. \(4(x - 1) + 2x\)

### 2.4.3 ‚Äì Common Mistakes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don‚Äôt forget to multiply each part inside the parentheses!**

> ‚ùå Incorrect:  
> \(2(x + 5) = 2x + 5\) ‚Üê **Didn‚Äôt multiply the 5**

> ‚úÖ Correct:  
> \(2(x + 5) = 2x + 10\)

Also, be careful with negatives:

> \[
> -3(x - 2) = -3x + 6
> \]

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="üí• Mistake or Not?"}
Decide if each simplification is correct. If not, explain the mistake.

1. \(4(x + 2) = 4x + 2\)  
2. \(-2(a - 3) = -2a + 6\)  
3. \(5(x - 1) + 3x = 8x - 5\)  
4. \(3(2x + 4) = 6x + 12\)
:::

---

### 2.4.4 ‚Äì Distribution and Combining Like Terms

You often need to combine like terms **after** distributing.

> **Example:**
> \[
> 2(x + 3) + 4x = 2x + 6 + 4x = 6x + 6
> \]

This is especially common in expressions with more than one set of terms.

## üèãÔ∏è Practice On Your Own

Expand and simplify each expression.

1. \(2(x + 5)\)  
2. \(3(y - 4)\)  
3. \(-4(x - 1)\)  
4. \(5(a + 2) - a\)  
5. \(6x + 2(x - 3)\)  
6. \(3(x + 4) + 2(x - 1)\)

Error check: Are these simplifications correct?

7. \(2(x + 3) = 2x + 3\)  
8. \(-3(x - 4) = -3x + 12\)  
9. \(4x + 3(x + 2) = 7x + 6\)  
10. \(2(x + 1) + 3x = 5x + 1\)
