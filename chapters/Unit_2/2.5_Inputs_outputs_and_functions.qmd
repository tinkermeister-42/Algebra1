# 2.5 ‚Äì Inputs, Outputs & Functions {.unnumbered}

You‚Äôve worked with expressions, and you‚Äôve seen how inputs can go through a rule to produce outputs. This is the heart of what functions are all about.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll explore how input-output rules work, what makes something a **function**, and how to tell when a relationship is or isn‚Äôt a function.

- I can describe a rule that connects inputs and outputs  
- I can tell whether a table or situation represents a function  
- I can use expressions to represent input-output relationships

1. A vending machine always gives the same snack when you press A1.  
   - Is that acting like a function? Why?

2. Now imagine sometimes A1 gives chips, sometimes candy.  
   - What‚Äôs the problem?

3. What‚Äôs something in your life that always depends on something else?

> These questions help students connect function ideas to real-life consistency ‚Äî one input gives one output.

### 2.5.1 ‚Äì Inputs ‚Üí Rule ‚Üí Outputs

You can describe a relationship using a **rule**. The rule takes an **input** and produces an **output**.

> **Example:**
>
> Rule: Multiply by 2 and add 1  
> Expression: \(2x + 1\)

| Input | Rule         | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| 1     | \(2 \cdot 1 + 1\) | 3      |
| 2     | \(2 \cdot 2 + 1\) | 5      |
| 3     | \(2 \cdot 3 + 1\) | 7      |

> _Suggestion: Use visual of input ‚Üí rule box ‚Üí output flow._

### 2.5.2 ‚Äì What Is a Function?

A **function** is a rule where **each input has exactly one output**.

- It‚Äôs **okay** if different inputs have the same output  
- It‚Äôs **not okay** if the same input gives more than one output

> **Example:**

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 2     | 3      |
| 2     | 4      |

‚ùå Not a function ‚Äî the input 2 gives two different outputs

### 2.5.3 ‚Äì Real-Life Functions

> ‚úÖ Function:  
> You pay \$3 per taco. Total cost depends on number of tacos.  
> Rule: \(3x\)

> ‚ùå Not a Function:  
> A person is matched to their favorite color‚Ä¶ but is listed twice with different colors.

> _Suggestion: Let students create their own ‚Äúfunction or not?‚Äù example and explain their reasoning._

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="ü§î Function or Not?"}
Decide if each scenario describes a function:

1. You press a microwave button and it always sets the same time.  
2. A dog is listed with two different owners.  
3. A student has different classes during the day.  
4. A single input gives two different outputs in a table.

Explain your reasoning.

### 2.5.4 ‚Äì Optional: Function Notation

You may see something like this:

\[
f(x) = 3x + 2
\]

This just means: ‚ÄúThe function named \(f\) gives this output when you plug in \(x\).‚Äù

- If \(x = 4\):  
  \[
  f(4) = 3 \cdot 4 + 2 = 14
  \]

> _You can use this now or introduce more fully in Unit 4._

## üèãÔ∏è Practice On Your Own

1. Fill in the table using the rule: \(2x + 1\)

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1     |        |
| 3     |        |
| 5     |        |

2. Write a rule for each situation:  
   a. You earn \$10/hour.  
   b. A car starts with 12 gallons and uses 0.3 gallons per mile.  
   c. A delivery costs \$5 plus \$2 per item.

3. Which of these are functions?

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 4      |
| 2     | 4      |
| 3     | 4      |

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 5      |
| 1     | 6      |
| 2     | 5      |

4. Create a function of your own. Show a table with at least 3 inputs and outputs.
