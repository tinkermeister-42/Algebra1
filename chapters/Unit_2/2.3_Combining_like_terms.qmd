# 2.3 – Combining Like Terms {.unnumbered}

Imagine you’re a cashier. At closing time you need to count the money in your drawer but it is all mixed up.

You sort by kind: $10 bills with $10 bills, $5 bills with $5 bills, quarters with quarters. Having the same kinds of money together makes it much easier to count. 

The same thing can happen when we simplify expressions. Sometimes they are messy. To clean them up, we sort by kind before adding things up. We call this combining {{< glink like terms >}}.

1. What do you get when you add:  
   a. \(5 + 7\)  
   b. \(2x + 4x\)  
   c. \(3x + 5y\)  

2. Which of these pairs are “like” and which are not?  
   - \(2x\) and \(5x\)  
   - \(x\) and \(x^2\)  
   - \(4y\) and \(4x\)

3. Why might we want to rewrite an expression in a simpler form?

### 2.3.1 – What Are Like Terms?

**Like terms** have the exact same variable part — including exponents.

> **Examples:**
> - \(2x\) and \(5x\) → ✅ like terms  
> - \(x^2\) and \(x^2\) → ✅ like terms  
> - \(3x\) and \(3y\) → ❌ not like terms  
> - \(x\) and \(x^2\) → ❌ not like terms

> _Suggested visual: Show a color-coded set of blocks or algebra tiles to group like terms visually._

### 2.3.2 – Combining Like Terms

To combine like terms:
1. Identify terms with the same variable part  
2. Add or subtract their **coefficients**

> **Example 1:**
> \[
> 3x + 5x = 8x
> \]

> **Example 2:**
> \[
> 7x - 2x = 5x
> \]

> **Example 3 (constants too):**
> \[
> 2x + 4 + 5x - 1 = 7x + 3
> \]

> _Visual option: Use algebra tiles to physically add and subtract blocks representing like terms._

Simplify each expression by combining like terms.

1. \(4x + 3x\)  
2. \(5a + 2b - 3a\)  
3. \(x + 2 + x + 5\)  
4. \(7m - 2m + 6 - 3\)

### 2.3.3 – Why Does This Work?

Combining like terms is just rewriting an expression in a simpler way — we’re not changing its meaning.

> \[
> 3x + 2x = 5x
> \]
> These expressions are **equivalent**. No matter what value \(x\) has, both expressions give the same result.

Try testing values like \(x = 1, 2, 5\) and compare both sides — they’ll always match.

> _Optional visual: Input-output table comparing \(3x + 2x\) and \(5x\)._

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="💭 Which Expressions Are Equivalent?"}
Decide if the following pairs are equivalent. Try simplifying first.

1. \(2x + 3x\) and \(5x\)  
2. \(5y - 2y + 1\) and \(3y + 1\)  
3. \(4x + 2\) and \(2x + 2x + 2\)  
4. \(x + x + x\) and \(3x\)
