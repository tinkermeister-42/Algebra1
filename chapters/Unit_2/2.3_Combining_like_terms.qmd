# 2.3 – Combining Like Terms {.unnumbered}

When we speak, we sometimes **shorten** a sentence without changing its meaning. We can do the same in algebra. Expressions can be messy, so we **clean them up** by putting **like things with like things** and then adding or subtracting. This is called **combining {{< glink like terms >}}**.

Think of a cashier counting money in a mixed drawer. They put tens with tens, fives with fives, quarters with quarters. Once things are **sorted**, they’re easy to **count**. In algebra, we sort by the **variable part** and then add the **coefficients**.

## 🔥 Warm-Up

1. What do you get when you add:

   * $5 + 7$
   * $2x + 4x$
   * $3x^2 + 5x^2$

2. For each pair, how are they similar and how are they different?

   * $2x$ and $5x$
   * $x$ and $x^2$
   * $4y$ and $4x$

3. Why might we want to rewrite an expression in a simpler form?

### 2.3.1 – What Are Like Terms?

Suppose you have apples, oranges, and bananas to sell.

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_3/mixed_fruit.png){width="300px"}

You can see what fruit is there, but it’s **messy**. Let’s **group by type** to clean it up.

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_3/sorted_fruit.png){width="400px"}

Now it’s easy to see how many you have of each kind—and it looks better for customers.

Algebraic expressions can be messy in the same way. Different kinds of {{< glink terms >}} get mixed together. To **simplify**, we first **group by type** and then add things up.

**What do we mean by “type”?**  
Two terms are the same type if their **variable part** (letters and exponents) matches exactly. We call these **{{< glink like terms >}}**.

**Like terms**

- $5x$ and $3x$
- $7$ and $-3$ *(both are {{< glink constants >}})*
- $2y^3$ and $y^3$
- $8xy$ and $2yx$ *(the order of the variables doesn't matter)*

**Not like terms**

- $2x$ and $3y$
- $4x^2$ and $2x^4$
- $7$ and $-3x$
- $3x^2y$ and $3xy^2$

:::{.remember} 
The **sign** (+ or -) belongs with the term. In $7x - 2x$ the terms are $+7x$ and $-2x$.

### 2.3.2 – How to Combine Like Terms (Sort → Group → Add)

In this messy expression, there are several terms of different types. It is difficult to see what we have.

$$
9a + 4c + 8b - 3a + b - 2c + 2a - 6b - 4a
$$

**Step 1:** To clean it up, let's **sort** by type.

$$
9a -3a +2a -4a + 4c - 2c + 8b + b - 6b
$$

**Step 2:** Now we **group** the like terms together.

$$
(9a - 3a + 2a - 4a) + (4c - 2c) + (8b + b - 6b)
$$

**Step 3:** To simplify we can **add** things up in each group.

$$ 
4a + 2c + 3b
$$

It is now obvious that we have 4 a's, 2 c's, and 3 b's. This process of sorting, grouping, and adding things up is called **combining like terms**. Doing this makes working with algebraic expressions much easier.

### 2.3.3 – Why Does This Work? (The idea behind it)

When the variable part matches, we can **factor** it like a common word:

$$
3x + 2x = (3+2)x = 5x \qquad\text{and}\qquad 4y - y = (4-1)y = 3y
$$

So $3x + 2x$ and $5x$ are **{{< glink equivalent expressions >}}**. They always give the same value for any $x$.

:::{.think title="Convince yourself"}
Pick a value (e.g., $x=10$). Compare $3x + 2x$ and $5x$. What do you notice?
:::

### 2.3.4 – Common Mistakes (Watch out!)

* **Different variable parts don’t combine:** $x$ and $x^2$ are not like; $xy$ and $x$ are not like.
* **Don’t mix variables with constants:** $2x + 3 \neq 5x$.
* **Mind the sign:** In $8x - 5x$, the second term is $-5x$, not $+5x$.

:::{.gotcha}
If you’re unsure, test with a number (substitution). If two forms always give the same value, they’re equivalent; if not, you changed the meaning.

### 2.3.5 – With Parentheses: “Open, Then Combine”

If parentheses are present, **simplify inside** (or distribute if needed in a later lesson), then combine like terms.

**Example D (reorder & combine)**

$$
(4x - 3) + (2 - 5x) \;\to\; (4x - 5x) + (-3 + 2) = -x - 1
$$

**Example E (a leading negative)**

$$
-(3x - 4) + 2x + 7 \;\to\; -3x + 4 + 2x + 7 = (-3x + 2x) + (4+7) = -x + 11
$$

:::{.you-try title="Try it with parentheses"}

1. $(5y + 2) - (3y - 6)$
2. $-(2x + 3) + (x - 5)$
:::

---

### 2.3.6 – By Variable and Exponent (mixing $x$, $x^2$, and constants)

We can (and should) combine **each kind** separately:

$$
4x^2 + 3x - 2 + x^2 - 5x + 6
= (4x^2 + x^2) + (3x - 5x) + (-2 + 6)
= 5x^2 - 2x + 4
$$

:::{.you-try title="Sort by kind"}

1. $2x^2 + 5x - 3 + 4x^2 - x + 1$
2. $7a^2 - 2a + 4 - 3a^2 + a - 6$
