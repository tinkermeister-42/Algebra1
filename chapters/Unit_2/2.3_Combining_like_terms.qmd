# 2.3 – Combining Like Terms {.unnumbered}

When we simplify an expression, we often look for pieces that can go together. In algebra, **like terms** are terms that have the same variable part. You can **combine** them by adding or subtracting their coefficients — just like counting apples or blocks of the same kind.

In this lesson, you’ll learn to spot like terms, combine them, and rewrite expressions in simpler forms. You’ll also see how this connects to the idea of equivalent expressions.

1. What do you get when you add:  
   a. \(5 + 7\)  
   b. \(2x + 4x\)  
   c. \(3x + 5y\)  

2. Which of these pairs are “like” and which are not?  
   - \(2x\) and \(5x\)  
   - \(x\) and \(x^2\)  
   - \(4y\) and \(4x\)

3. Why might we want to rewrite an expression in a simpler form?

### 2.3.1 – What Are Like Terms?

**Like terms** have the exact same variable part — including exponents.

> **Examples:**
> - \(2x\) and \(5x\) → ✅ like terms  
> - \(x^2\) and \(x^2\) → ✅ like terms  
> - \(3x\) and \(3y\) → ❌ not like terms  
> - \(x\) and \(x^2\) → ❌ not like terms

> _Suggested visual: Show a color-coded set of blocks or algebra tiles to group like terms visually._

### 2.3.2 – Combining Like Terms

To combine like terms:
1. Identify terms with the same variable part  
2. Add or subtract their **coefficients**

> **Example 1:**
> \[
> 3x + 5x = 8x
> \]

> **Example 2:**
> \[
> 7x - 2x = 5x
> \]

> **Example 3 (constants too):**
> \[
> 2x + 4 + 5x - 1 = 7x + 3
> \]

> _Visual option: Use algebra tiles to physically add and subtract blocks representing like terms._

Simplify each expression by combining like terms.

1. \(4x + 3x\)  
2. \(5a + 2b - 3a\)  
3. \(x + 2 + x + 5\)  
4. \(7m - 2m + 6 - 3\)

### 2.3.3 – Why Does This Work?

Combining like terms is just rewriting an expression in a simpler way — we’re not changing its meaning.

> \[
> 3x + 2x = 5x
> \]
> These expressions are **equivalent**. No matter what value \(x\) has, both expressions give the same result.

Try testing values like \(x = 1, 2, 5\) and compare both sides — they’ll always match.

> _Optional visual: Input-output table comparing \(3x + 2x\) and \(5x\)._

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="💭 Which Expressions Are Equivalent?"}
Decide if the following pairs are equivalent. Try simplifying first.

1. \(2x + 3x\) and \(5x\)  
2. \(5y - 2y + 1\) and \(3y + 1\)  
3. \(4x + 2\) and \(2x + 2x + 2\)  
4. \(x + x + x\) and \(3x\)
