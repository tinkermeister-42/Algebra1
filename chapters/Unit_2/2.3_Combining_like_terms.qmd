# 2.3 ‚Äì Combining Like Terms {.unnumbered}

When we speak, we sometimes **shorten** a sentence without changing its meaning. We can do the same in algebra. Expressions can be messy, so we **clean them up** by putting **like things with like things** and then adding or subtracting. This is called **combining {{< glink like terms >}}**.

Think of a cashier counting money in a mixed drawer. They put tens with tens, fives with fives, quarters with quarters. Once things are **sorted**, they‚Äôre easy to **count**. In algebra, we sort by the **variable part** and then add the **coefficients**.

1. What do you get when you add:

   * $5 + 7$
   * $2x + 4x$
   * $3x^2 + 5x^2$

2. For each pair, how are they similar and how are they different?

   * $2x$ and $5x$

### 2.3.1 ‚Äì What Are Like Terms?

Suppose you have apples, oranges, and bananas to sell.

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_3/mixed_fruit.png){width="300px"}

You can see what fruit is there, but it‚Äôs **messy**. Let‚Äôs **group by type** to clean it up.

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_3/sorted_fruit.png){width="400px"}

Now it‚Äôs easy to see how many you have of each kind‚Äîand it looks better for customers.

Algebraic expressions can be messy in the same way. Different kinds of {{< glink terms >}} get mixed together. To **simplify**, we first **group by type** before adding things up.

**What do we mean by ‚Äútype‚Äù?**  
Two terms are the same type if their **variable part** (letters and exponents) matches exactly. We call these **{{< glink like terms >}}**.

**Like terms**

- $5x$ and $3x$
- $7$ and $-3$ *(both are {{< glink constants >}})*
- $2y^3$ and $y^3$
- $8xy$ and $2yx$ *(the order of the variables doesn't matter)*

**Not like terms**

- $2x$ and $3y$
- $4x^2$ and $2x^4$
- $7$ and $-3x$
- $3x^2y$ and $3xy^2$

:::{.remember} 
The **sign** (+ or -) belongs with the term. In $7x - 2x$ the terms are $+7x$ and $-2x$.
:::

:::{.gotcha title="Powers matter!"}

Always remember that the powers need to be the same. That means terms like $p^3$ and $p^2$ are **not** like terms. They have the same variable "p" but they do not have the same exponents.

:::

:::{.you-try-m title="Which of the following pairs are like terms?"}

a. $5$ and $-42$

b. $32y$ and $32x$

c. $9x^2y^3$ and $9x^3y^2$

d. $-\frac{1}{3}a^4$ and $1.5a^4$

e. $252xyz$ and $525yxz$

### 2.3.2 ‚Äì How to Combine Like Terms (Sort ‚Üí Group ‚Üí Add)

Now that you can identify like terms, let's see how to use this to help us simplify expressions.

**Example 1**:

In this messy expression, there are several terms of different types. Like with the fruit, it is difficult to see what we have.

$$
9a + 4c + 8b - 3a + b - 2c + 2a - 6b - 4a
$$

**Step 1:** To clean it up, let's **sort** by type.

$$
9a -3a +2a -4a + 4c - 2c + 8b + b - 6b
$$

**Step 2:** Now we **group** the like terms together.

$$
(9a - 3a + 2a - 4a) + (4c - 2c) + (8b + b - 6b)
$$

**Step 3:** To simplify we can **add** things up in each group.

$$ 
4a + 2c + 3b
$$

In the same way that it became easy to count the different types of fruit, it is now obvious that we have 4 a's, 2 c's, and 3 b's. This process of sorting, grouping, and adding things up is called **combining like terms**. Doing this makes working with algebraic expressions much easier.

:::{.think title="Why can we reorder and group terms?"}

We can change the order because addition is {{< glink commutative >}} (and subtraction is adding a negative).

We can then group terms together because addition is {{< glink associative >}}.

:::

**Example 2**

Simplify the following expression.

$$
-1.5x + 2.5 + 3.5x^2 - 0.5 + 5.5x - 2 - 4.0x - 4.5x^2
$$

First, sort the terms by type:

$$
3.5x^2 - 4.5x^2 -1.5x + 5.5x - 4.0x + 2.5 -0.5 -2.0
$$

Next, group like terms:

$$
(3.5x^2 - 4.5x^2) + (-1.5x + 5.5x - 4.0x) + (2.5 - 0.5 - 2.0)
$$

Finally, add up the coefficients in each group.

$$
-1.0x^2 + 0.0x + 0.0 = -x^2
$$

:::{.gotcha title="Watch out for those negative signs!"}

In the previous example, notice what happened when we grouped the $x$ terms. The negative stayed with $-1.5x$. We had to put a "+" sign in between the $x^2$ group and the $x$ group.

What would happen if we forgot that the negative stayed with the term? 

If we forgot, then the whole $x$ group would become negative.

$$
\color{gray}(3.5x^2 - 4.5x^2)\color{black} - \color{red}{(1.5x + 5.5x - 4.0x)} \color{gray}+ (2.5 - 0.5 - 2.0)
$$

But that simplifies to a very different **incorrect answer**!:

$$
\color{gray}-x^2 \color{red} -3.0x
$$

:::{.real-world title="Lunch orders"}
Imagine you are on a field trip with your class and the bus stops to order fast food. If there are 50 people on the bus, it would be crazy to place each order individually, it would take forever. 

So, instead of making individual orders like, "One cheeseburger with fries and a drink." 50 times. It would make more sense to group by type and make one order.

"We need 28 cheeseburgers, 22 plain burgers, 40 orders of fries, and 35 drinks".

The person taking orders (and the people behind you in line) will appreciate that you can combine like terms!

:::

:::{.you-try title="Simplify $2z - 3z^2 + 5z^3 - z^2 + 5z^3 - 8 - z$"}

$$
5z^3 + 5z^3 - 3z^2 - z^2 + 2z -z -8 =
$$
$$
(5z^3 + 5z^3) + (-3z^2 - z^2) + (2z - z) + (-8) =
$$
$$
10z^3 - 4z^2 + z - 8
$$

### 2.3.3 ‚Äì Checking Your Work

When simplifying expressions it is easy to make a mistake. If you are unsure, test with numbers and {{< glink substitution >}}.

$$
5x - 3x^2 + 2x - 7 + 3x^2 + 3 =
$$
$$
-3x^2 + 3x^2 + 5x + 2x - 7 + 3 =
$$
$$
(-3x^2 + 3x^2) + (5x + 2x) + (-7 + 3) =
$$
$$
7x - 4
$$

Let's evaluate both expressions when $x=2$.

$$
5(2) - 3(2)^2 + 2(2) - 7 + 3(2)^2 + 3 =
$$
$$
10 - 12 + 4 - 7 + 12 + 3 = 10
$$

And...

$$
7(2) - 4 =
$$
$$
14 - 4 = 10
$$

This is evidence that we combined like terms correctly.

:::{.you-try title="Simplify $3b - 2 + 4b - 5$ and check your work."}

Simplify the expression by combining like terms.
$$
3b + 4b - 2 - 5 = 7b - 7
$$

We could pick any non-zero number. Let's try $b = 3$:

In the original expression we get 14.
$$
3(3) + 4(3) - 2 - 5 = 9 + 12 - 2 - 5 = 14
$$

We also get 14 in our simplified expression!

$$
7(3) - 7 = 21 - 7 = 14
$$
