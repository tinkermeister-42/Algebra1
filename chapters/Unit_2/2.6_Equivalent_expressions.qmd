# 2.6 ‚Äì Equivalent Expressions {.unnumbered}

Sometimes two expressions look different ‚Äî but they always give the same result. That means they‚Äôre **equivalent expressions**.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn how to recognize when expressions are equivalent by simplifying, using substitution, and thinking logically. This idea is a big deal in Algebra ‚Äî especially when we start solving equations.

1. Which of these are equal?  
   a. \(2x + 3x\) and \(5x\)  
   b. \(3x + 4\) and \(4 + 3x\)  
   c. \(x + 5\) and \(5x\)

2. How could you check whether two expressions are equal ‚Äî without guessing?

3. If two expressions are equal for *every* value of \(x\), what does that tell you?

### 2.6.1 ‚Äì What Does ‚ÄúEquivalent‚Äù Mean?

Two expressions are **equivalent** if they always have the same value for any input.

> **Example:**  
> \(2x + 3x\) and \(5x\) are equivalent  
> Try substituting \(x = 1, 2, 10\) ‚Äî both always give the same result.

### 2.6.2 ‚Äì Ways to Check for Equivalence

**Strategy 1: Simplify both expressions**

> \[
> 2x + 3x \rightarrow 5x
> \]
> Now it‚Äôs easy to see they‚Äôre the same.

**Strategy 2: Substitute a value**

> Try \(x = 2\):  
>  
> - \(2x + 3x = 4 + 6 = 10\)  
> - \(5x = 10\)

> _Note: This doesn‚Äôt prove they‚Äôre equivalent for all values, but it‚Äôs a good check._

**Strategy 3: Think about structure**

> \[
> 3(x + 2) \text{ vs. } 3x + 6
> \]
> Distribute to see if they match.

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="üí° Are These Equivalent?"}
Decide if each pair of expressions is equivalent. Use any strategy.

1. \(2x + 4x\) and \(6x\)  
2. \(3(x + 2)\) and \(3x + 2\)  
3. \(4x + 6\) and \(2(2x + 3)\)  
4. \(x + x + x\) and \(3x\)  
5. \(x^2 + 2x + 1\) and \((x + 1)^2\)

### 2.6.3 ‚Äì Why Equivalent Expressions Matter

Even though expressions can look different, they might represent the same thing.

> **Real-world example:**  
> You pay \$3 per item and a \$2 fee.  
> - One store writes it: \(3x + 2\)  
> - Another writes it: \(2 + 3x\)

They mean the same thing. That‚Äôs helpful when comparing prices, combining steps, or solving equations.

> _Suggestion: Use a visual (two receipts or diagrams) to show real-world equivalence._

## üèãÔ∏è Practice On Your Own

Simplify both expressions. Are they equivalent?

1. \(5x + 2x\) and \(7x\)  
2. \(4(x + 3)\) and \(4x + 12\)  
3. \(6x + 3 - 2x\) and \(4x + 3\)  
4. \(3(x - 1)\) and \(3x - 3\)  
5. \(x^2 + 4\) and \((x + 2)^2\)

Create your own equivalent expressions:

6. Start with: \(2x + 6\).  
   - Write a different-looking expression that‚Äôs equivalent.

7. Start with: \(5(x + 2)\).  
   - Write an expression that is **not** equivalent.

Explain your reasoning for 6 and 7.

:::{.answers collapse=true}
**‚úÖ Answer Key**

1. Yes ‚Äî both simplify to \(7x\)  
2. Yes ‚Äî distribute: \(4x + 12\)  
3. Yes ‚Äî simplify left: \(4x + 3\)  
4. Yes ‚Äî distribute: \(3x - 3\)  
5. No ‚Äî \(x^2 + 4\) is not the same as \(x^2 + 4x + 4\)

6. Example: \(2(x + 3)\) ‚Äî distributes to \(2x + 6\)  
7. Example: \(5x + 2\) ‚Äî not the same (would give different outputs)

Answers may vary ‚Äî look for clear structure and explanation.
