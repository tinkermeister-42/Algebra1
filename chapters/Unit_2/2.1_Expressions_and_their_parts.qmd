# 2.1 – Expressions & Their Parts {.unnumbered}

Algebra is like a language — it uses **expressions** to describe patterns, relationships, and real-world situations. Expressions are math phrases made from numbers, symbols, and variables. Before we can simplify or solve them, we need to know what they are and how to talk about their parts.

In this lesson, you’ll learn what a variable is, what makes up an expression, and how to identify key parts like {{< glink terms >}}, {{< glink coefficients >}}, and {{< glink constants >}}.

### 2.1.1 – What Is a Variable?

Sometimes we need to talk about a number we don’t know yet — or one that can change. For that, we use a {{< glink variable >}}.

A variable is a letter or {{< glink symbol >}} that stands for an unknown or changing number. Algebra often uses **x**, but other letters work too.

Think of **x** as the label on a mystery box: you know there’s a number inside, but you don’t know which one.

**Example:**

You work at a grocery store. Your boss gives you labels and points to boxes of apples:  
“Write how many apples are in each box.”

You pick up a sealed box. You can’t see inside, so you write **x** on the label — x means “the number of apples in this box (unknown).”

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxX.png){width="35%" fig-align="center"}

Your boss says, “Check inside.” You open the box: there are 3 apples.

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxOpen.png){width="35%" fig-align="center"}

Now you know the number, so you change the label to 3.

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBox3.png){width="35%" fig-align="center"}

Before opening it, **x** was a variable — a placeholder for an unknown number. After looking, you found $x = 3$.

### 2.1.2 – What Is an Expression?

An **expression** is a math phrase made of numbers, variables, and {{< glink operations >}}. Expressions do **not** compare values — so $2x$ and $5$ are expressions, but $2x = 5$ is not (that’s an equation).

**Examples of expressions:**

- $3x$
- $2x - 7$
- $\tfrac{1}{2}(y + 4)$
- $x^2 - 3x + 4$
- $9$

**Not expressions:**

- $3x + 5 = 20$ *(equation — has an equals sign)*  
- $x > 7$ *(comparison)*  

::: {.you-try-m title="Think about this."}
You have two situations:

1. The total number of pencils in 7 boxes.
2. Whether the total number of pencils is equal to 20.

- Can both be represented by a single expression? 
- Which one cannot? 
- Explain your reasoning.
:::
::: {.answer title="Answer"}
- Situation 1: Yes — you can write `7p` if `p` is pencils per box.
- Situation 2: No — this is a comparison, not a single expression. Expressions describe quantities; they don’t make comparisons.
:::


::: {.gotcha title="Where did the multiply sign go?"}
In algebra, we usually don’t use $\times$ for multiplication. Instead, we use a dot "$\cdot$" or simply place terms next to each other ({{< glink multiplication by proximity >}}).

**Three ways to write “3 times x”:**
- $3 \times x$  *(rarely used)*  
- $3 \cdot x$  
- $3x$  

Why avoid $\times$? To keep it from looking like the variable x.
:::

**Example:**

Back to the apple boxes: before, you had one box. Now suppose you have 5 boxes, each with **x** apples.

::: {.text-center}
![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxX.png){ width=100px } 
![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxX.png){ width=100px } 
![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxX.png){ width=100px } 
![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxX.png){ width=100px } 
![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxX.png){ width=100px } 
:::

If each box has **x** apples, then the total is $5 \cdot x$ or simply $5x$.

::: {.you-try title="10 boxes of pencils"}
Let $p$ = pencils per box.  
Total pencils = $10p$
:::

---

### 2.1.3 – Terms, Coefficients, and Constants

Expressions are made of **terms**. A term may have a variable with a **coefficient** (the number in front) or be a **constant** (a number without a variable).

Example: $4x + 2y - 7$

$$
\huge{
\underbrace{\color{blue}{4}x}_{\text{term}}
\;
\underbrace{+\color{blue}{2}y}_{\text{term}}
\;
\underbrace{-\color{red}{7}}_{\text{term}}
}
$$

- **Terms** are separated by $+$ or $-$: $4x$, $2y$, $-7$  
- **Coefficients** multiply a variable: 4 and 2  
- **Constants** are numbers that don’t change: $-7$

::: {.gotcha title="Don’t forget the sign!"}
- The sign (+ or −) belongs to the term.  
- A lone variable has an **implied coefficient** of 1.

**Example 1:**  
$-5x^2 - 2x$ → terms: $-5x^2$, $-2x$  

**Example 2:**  
$3x^2 + x - y$ → terms: $3x^2$, $x$, $-y$; coefficients: 3, 1, -1
:::

::: {.you-try collapse=true title="Make your own expression with 4+ terms"}
Example: $18x - 2y + 3z - 1$  
Terms: $18x$, $-2y$, $3z$, $-1$  
Coefficients: 18, -2, 3  
Constant: -1
:::

### 2.1.4 – Translating Between Words and Expressions

**Expressions** are math phrases that describe real situations. Learning to turn words into expressions is one of the most important skills in algebra because it connects math to real life — and it’s the first step to solving real-world problems.

---

**Examples:**

- You have 5 boxes of apples. Each box has **x** apples.  
  Number of apples: $5x$

- You earn $12 per hour for **h** hours.  
  Total earnings: $12h$

- Your friend has **n** games. You have 3 more than your friend.  
  Your games: $n + 3$

- A taxi charges $10 plus $2 for each mile **m**.  
  Total cost: $10 + 2m$

- A plant starts at **g** inches tall and grows 8 inches.  
  New height: $g + 8$

---

::: {.you-try title="Rectangle width from length"}
A rectangle has length **L**. The width is 2 more than 4 times the length.  
$4L + 2$
:::

---

**Why Order Matters:**  
Knowing the **order of operations** helps you write the correct expression.  
- “Double $x$, then add 3” → $2x + 3$  
- “Add 3 to $x$, then double” → $2(x + 3)$
