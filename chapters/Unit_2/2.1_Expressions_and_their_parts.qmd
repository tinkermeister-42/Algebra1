# 2.1 – Expressions & Their Parts {.unnumbered}

Algebra is a language made of **expressions** — math phrases that use numbers, symbols, and variables to describe patterns or situations. Before we learn to simplify or solve anything, we need to understand what expressions are and how to describe their parts.

In this lesson, you’ll learn what a variable is, what makes up an expression, and how to recognize important parts like {{< glink terms >}}, {{< glink coefficients >}}, and {{< glink constants >}}.

## 👥 Learn Together

### 2.1.1 – What Is a Variable?

Sometimes we need to talk about a number we don’t know yet—or one that can change. For that, we use a {{< glink variable >}}.

A variable is a letter or {{< glink symbol >}} that stands for an unknown or changing number. You can use many letters, but in algebra we most often use **x**.

Think of an **x** as the label on a mystery box. You know the box holds a number inside, but you don't know which number it is yet! 

**Example:**

You work at a grocery store. Your boss hands you a stack of labels and points to some apple boxes: “Write how many apples are in each box.”

You pick up a sealed box. You can’t see inside, so you write x on the label — x stands for “the number of apples in this box (unknown).”

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxX.png){width=35% fig-align=center}

Your boss isn’t satisfied and says, “Check inside.” You open the box and peek: there are 3 apples.

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBoxOpen.png){width=35% fig-align=center}

Now that you know the number, you change the label to 3.

![](/images/Unit_2/Lesson_1/AppleBox3.png){width=35% fig-align=center}

Before you opened it, x was a {{< glink variable >}}—a placeholder for an unknown number.
After you looked, you found $x = 3$, so you replaced the variable with the number.

### 2.1.2 – What Is an Expression?

An **expression** is a math phrase made of numbers, variables, and {{< glink operations >}} — **but no equal sign**.

**Examples (expressions):**

* $3x + 5$
* $x - 7$
* $\tfrac{1}{2}(y + 4)$
* $4(a - 3)$

**Not expressions (these make a claim):**

* $3x + 5 = 20$  *(has an equals sign → an equation)*
* $x > 7$        *(comparison)*

::: {.gotcha title="Where did the multiply sign go?"}
In algebra we often multiply by just **putting things next to each other**.
We call this **multiplication by proximity**.

* $3x$ means $3 \times x$
* $4(a-3)$ means $4 \times (a-3)$
:::

::: {.real-world}
**Price × quantity:** If stickers cost \$0.50 each and you buy $s$ stickers, the cost is $0.50s$. That’s multiplication by proximity in the wild.
:::

::: {.visual-note}
**Visual idea:** Two columns “Expression / Not an Expression.” On the right, highlight the equals sign in color. On the left, show $3x$ with a tiny label “proximity = multiply.”
:::

---

### 2.1.3 – Terms, Coefficients, and Constants

Consider:

$$
4x + 2y - 7
$$

* **Terms** are the chunks separated by $+$ or $-$: $4x$, $2y$, $-7$.
* A **coefficient** tells “how many copies of the variable”: 4 is the coefficient of $x$; 2 is the coefficient of $y$.
* A **constant** is a number that doesn’t change: $-7$.

::: {.remember}

* The **sign in front** belongs to the term → the last term here is **$-7$**.
* A lone variable has an **implied coefficient of 1**.
  Examples: coefficient of $x$ is $1$; coefficient of $-y$ is $-1$.
:::

::: {.visual-note}
**Visual idea:** Show $4x + 2y - 7$. Circle each term, box the coefficients, underline the constant. Add a mini-example $-y + 9$ to spotlight the **coefficient $-1$** idea.
:::

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="📝 Label the parts in $9 - 3x + y$. What are the terms, coefficients, and constant?"}
**Answer:** terms: $9$, $-3x$, $y$; coefficients: $x \to -3$, $y \to 1$; constant: $9$.
:::

### 2.1.4 – Reading Expressions in Words

Expressions are short stories.

* $10h$: “\$10 **per hour** for $h$ hours.”
* $s + 15$: “start at speed $s$, then increase by 15.”
* $5x$: “5 in each group, $x$ groups.”
* $2(x + 3)$: “double the amount **after** adding 3.”

::: {.gotcha title="Order in words matters"}

* “Twice a number **increased by 3**” → $2x + 3$
* “Twice **the number increased by 3**” → $2(x + 3)$
  Those are **not** the same.
:::

::: {.real-world}
**Step then scale:** A club charges a \$5 sign-up fee and then doubles your donation. If you donate $d$, the club adds \$5 first, then doubles: $2(d + 5)$.
:::

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="Say $3(y-2)$ in words. What happens first? What happens next?"}
**Answer:** “Take $y$, subtract 2, **then** triple the result.” First subtract, then multiply.
:::

---

### 2.1.5 – Writing Expressions for Situations

From situation → expression:

* You have **3 more apples** than your friend, who has $x$. → $x + 3$
* A shirt costs \$12. You buy $n$ shirts. → $12n$ *(multiplication by proximity)*
* A plant is **8 inches** tall and grows $g$ inches each day. → $8 + g$
* You spend \$20 and then buy **2 items** that cost $x$ each. → $20 + 2x$

::: {.real-world}
**Travel:** A bus goes 45 miles per hour. After $t$ hours, the distance is $45t$. That’s proximity multiplication again (speed × time).
:::

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="A taxi charges a \$3 start fee plus \$2 per mile for $m$ miles. Write an expression."}
**Answer:** $3 + 2m$.
:::

:::{.you-try collapse=true title="A rectangle has length $L$. Its width is 3 less than its length. Write the width and the perimeter."}
**Answer:** width $= L - 3$; perimeter $= 2L + 2(L - 3) = 4L - 6$.
:::

### 2.1.6 – Concept Lab: Build an Expression

We’ll *build* expressions from pieces to feel what each part means. (Tiles, paper strips, or quick sketches work great.)

1. “Three $x$’s and two more.” Arrange **$x, x, x, 1, 1$**.
   Write: $3x + 2$.
2. “Double the amount after adding 4.” Build **$x, 1, 1, 1, 1$**; then duplicate the group.
   Write: $2(x+4)$.
3. “Start at 10, then lose 2 each game for $g$ games.”
   Write: $10 - 2g$.

::: {.visual-note}
**Visual idea:** A photo/diagram of (a) $3x+2$ arranged with tiles, (b) two identical groups for $2(x+4)$. Minimal labels so students do the talking.
:::

---

### 2.1.7 – Common Misconceptions

* **Don’t add a ‘×’**: $3x$ already means multiply (multiplication by proximity).
* **Sign goes with the term**: in $9 - 2x$, the second term is $-2x$.
* **“Less than” flips order**: “6 fewer than a number” → $x - 6$, not $6 - x$.
* **Coefficient ≠ exponent**: in $4x^2$, 4 is the coefficient; the 2 is an exponent (“square”).

## ✍️ Practice On Your Own

**Identify the Parts**

For each, list **terms**, give the **coefficient** for each variable, and the **constant(s)**.

1. $7x - 5$
2. $3a + 4b - 9$
3. $5x + 2y - 6$
4. $-y + 12$
5. $\tfrac{1}{2}m + 4 - 3n$

---

**Say It in Words**

Write a short sentence (in your own words) for each expression.

6. $9 + t$
7. $0.5x$
8. $4(n - 1)$
9. $3p + 7$
10. $2(x+3)$

---

**From Situation to Expression**

11. You have $x$ stickers. Your friend gives you 6 more.
12. A gym costs \$20 to join plus \$8 per month for $m$ months.
13. A tank starts with 50 liters and drains 3 liters each minute for $t$ minutes.
14. A rectangle’s width is $w$; its length is 5 more than its width. (Write length and perimeter.)
15. A phone plan includes 2 GB free, then charges \$5 per extra GB $g$.

---

**Match the Story to the Expression**

**Stories**
a) “Double the amount after adding 2.”
b) “Start at 10, then subtract 3 each day $d$.”
c) “\$4 per ticket for $t$ tickets, plus a \$6 fee.”
d) “Three groups of $x$, then add 1.”
e) “Half of $m$, then add 5.”

**Expressions**
A) $2(x+2)$  B) $10-3d$  C) $4t+6$  D) $3x+1$  E) $\tfrac12 m+5$

---

**Which One Doesn’t Belong?**

16. $2x+6$  $2(x+3)$  $x+x+6$  $x+3+x+3$
17. $5n-2$  $5(n-2)$  $n+n+n+n+n-2$  $5(n+2)$

---

**Error Analysis**

18. A student says the coefficient of $y$ in $-y+9$ is 0 because there’s no number in front. What would you say?
19. A student writes “6 fewer than a number” as $6-x$. Explain and correct it.
20. A student says $2x+3$ and $2(x+3)$ mean the same thing. Give a counterexample by choosing a value of $x$.

---

**Real-World Mix**

21. **Shopping:** Each notebook costs \$5 and you also buy one binder for \$2. Write two different expressions for the total with $n$ notebooks.
22. **Reading goal:** You start with 7 points and earn 0.25 points per hour $h$. Write an expression.
23. **Road trip:** A car travels 60 miles per hour. How far in $t$ hours? What if the car already started 30 miles ahead?

---

**Challenge Problems**

24. Two different stories lead to the **same expression**. Create **two** real-world stories that both match $2x + 6$. Explain why they both fit.
25. Find a value of $x$ that makes $2x + 3 = 2(x + 3)$ **false** and explain what this shows about order and grouping.

:::{.answers}

**A. Identify the Parts**

1. terms: $7x$, $-5$; coeff: $x\to 7$; constant: $-5$
2. terms: $3a$, $4b$, $-9$; coeffs: $a\to 3$, $b\to 4$; constant: $-9$
3. terms: $5x$, $2y$, $-6$; coeffs: $x\to 5$, $y\to 2$; constant: $-6$
4. terms: $-y$, $12$; coeff: $y\to -1$; constant: $12$
5. terms: $\tfrac12 m$, $4$, $-3n$; coeffs: $m\to \tfrac12$, $n\to -3$; constant: $4$

**B. Words** *(sample)*
6\) add 9 to $t$ 7) half of $x$ 8) four times one less than $n$
9\) three times $p$, then add 7 10) double the amount after adding 3

**C. Situations**
11\) $x+6$
12\) $20+8m$
13\) $50-3t$
14\) length $= w+5$; perimeter $= 2w + 2(w+5) = 4w+10$
15\) $2+5g$

**D. Match**
a→A, b→B, c→C, d→D, e→E

**E. WODB** *(many answers okay—justify!)*
16\) All four are equivalent to $2x+6$ → you could say “none doesn’t belong,” or pick one and justify.
17\) $5(n-2)=5n-10$ differs from the others (which equal $5n-2$ or $5n+10$).

**F. Error Analysis**
18\) The coefficient is $-1$ in $-y$; a lone variable has an implied 1, and the sign belongs to the term.
19\) “6 fewer than a number” means *take 6 away from the number* → $x-6$, not $6-x$.
20\) Try $x=1$: $2x+3=5$ but $2(x+3)=8$. Not the same.

**G. Real-World Mix**
21\) $5n+2$ and $2+5n$
22\) $7+0.25h$
23\) distance $= 60t$; with a 30-mile head start: $30+60t$

**Challenge**
24\) sample stories:

* “Buy $x$ movie tickets at \$2 each and a \$6 service fee” → $2x+6$
* “Two packs of snacks at \$x each, plus \$6 delivery” → $2x+6$
  Both describe “two times something, then add six,” so both fit.

25. e.g., $x=1$: $2x+3=5$ but $2(x+3)=8$ → not equal. This shows **grouping** changes the meaning: $2x+3$ is “double $x$, then add 3,” while $2(x+3)$ is “add 3, then double.”
