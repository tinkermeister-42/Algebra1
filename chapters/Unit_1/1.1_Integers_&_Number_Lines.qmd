# 1.1 - Integers & Number Lines {.unnumbered}

Did you know that all of mathematics is actually built up from simple things like counting? Even advanced topics like {{< glink algebra >}} and {{< glink calculus >}} are just clever ways of organizing and extending basic ideas — like moving forward and backward on a {{< glink number line >}}.

In this lesson, we’ll use the number line not just to count, but to add, subtract, and compare {{< glink positive >}} and {{< glink negative >}} numbers. That might sound basic, but it’s the foundation of nearly everything else you’ll do in Algebra.

Negative numbers can be tricky, especially when the rules don’t always match what your gut tells you. But if you can master the way they work on the number line — including things like {{< glink opposites >}}, {{< glink absolute value >}}, and comparison — you’ll be setting yourself up for success in the rest of the course.

### 1.1.1 - The Number Line Is More Than Just Counting

You already know how to count — 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. The **number line** extends that idea in both directions.


**Let’s draw a number line from -10 to 10**
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/blank_numberline.png)

Here, every tick mark is an {{< glink integer >}} — a whole number.

- Numbers to the **right** of zero are {{< glink positive >}}
- Numbers to the **left** of zero are {{< glink negative >}}

We can use this number line to *see* what happens when we add, subtract, or compare numbers.

**Are there other ways to draw a number line?**

Yes! Number lines can be drawn over different ranges and scales. For example, here is a number line that counts form -10 to 25 in steps of 5.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/count_by_5s.png)

In fact, number lines don't even have to be {{< glink horizontal >}}. Here is a {{< glink vertical >}} number line that goes from 0 to 100 in steps of 10.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/vertical_by_tens.png)

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Can you think of any real world examples of number lines?"}

Here are a few examples:

- thermometer
- ruler
- timeline
- American football field
- volume slider on a phone 
:::

:::{.callout-caution title="How many numbers are between 3 and 5?"}

Though there are 2 {{< glink integers >}} between 3 and 5, the answer is not 2! There are infinitely many numbers between 3 and 5. Here are some number lines that might help convince you.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/three_to_five_by_1.png)

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/between_3_and_5_by_025.png)

### 1.1.2 - Understanding Opposites

Let’s look at a pair of numbers, 3 and -3.

These are called {{< glink opposite >}} numbers. They are the **same distance** from zero but on **opposite sides** of it.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/opposites.png)

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 What is the opposite of zero?"}

The opposite of zero is zero. Zero is the only number that is its own opposite!
:::

---

### 1.1.3 - What Is Absolute Value?

{{< glink Absolute value >}} ($|number|$) measures the **distance from zero**, no matter the direction.

Take a look at the number -5. The number line shows that it's absolute value is 5 because it is 5 units away from zero.
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/absolute_value_negative_five.png)


You can see that |5| is also 5 for the same reason!
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/absolute_value_five.png)

:::{.callout-tip .realworld-box icon=false title="🌍 In the Real World"}
Absolute value is often used for describing the distance between two points. Suppose you live 3 miles to the east of the school and your best friend lives 5 miles to the west. How far apart are your houses? This is easy to see with a number line.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/east_to_west.png)

You can compute your distances by adding |-5| + |3|, by |-5 - 3|, or by |3 - (-5)|. All three of these give the same answer, 8 miles. What would change if we did not use absolute value?
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Can the absolute value ever be negative?"}

Absolute value is **never** negative, because distance is never negative.

### 1.1.4 - Comparing Integers

We can also use the number line to compare values. 

Let’s compare 2 to -7.
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/compare_2_to_neg7.png)


You can see from the number line that 2 is greater than (&gt;) -7 because 2 is to the right of -7.  

You can also see that -7 is further from zero than 2 and so |-7| > |2|.

:::{.callout-caution title="Which is **bigger**?"}
It is easy to get confused here. When we say which is "bigger" we are asking which number is further to the right on the number line, **not** which one is furthest from zero.
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Try comparing 3 to -8 using a number line."}
3 > -8 because it is farther to the right but |-8| > |3| because -8 is further from zero.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/compare_3_to_neg8.png)

### 1.1.5 - Number Lines and Arithmetic

We can also use the number line to model **adding and subtracting** integers.

* To add a {{< glink positive >}} number, move **right**
* To add a {{< glink negative >}} number, move **left**


Examples:

1. Addition: $-2 + 6 = 4$
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/add_6_to_neg2.png)

:::{.callout-tip .realworld-box icon=false title="🌍 In the Real World"}
Imagine that you are \$2 in debt. If someone pays you \$6 you can pay off the debt and have \$$4$ left over.
:::

2. Adding a negative: $150 + (-5) = 145$
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/add_neg5_to_150.png)

:::{.callout-tip .realworld-box icon=false title="🌍 In the Real World"}
You have \$150 in the bank. The bank ads a fee for being under their \$200 minimum balance. You now have \$145.
:::

3. Subtraction: $400 - 450 = -50$ 
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/subtract_450_from_400.png)

:::{.callout-tip .realworld-box icon=false title="🌍 In the Real World"}
If you only have \$400 but spend \$450 on a credit card. You are now \$50 in debt.
:::

4. Subtracting a negative: $201 - (-5) = 206$
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/subtract_neg5_from_201.png)

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Can You think of a real-world example for the previous example?"}

> Example:
> The bank made a mistake, you had \$$201$ in your account so they took off the \$$5$ fee. Now you have \$$206$.
