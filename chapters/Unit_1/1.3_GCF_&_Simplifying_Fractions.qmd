# 1.3 ‚Äì GCF & Simplifying Fractions {.unnumbered}

Ever tried to share something fairly ‚Äî like splitting snacks or organizing teams into equal groups? That‚Äôs the idea behind the **greatest common factor**, or GCF. It tells us how much we can evenly divide into *two or more* numbers.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn how to use **prime factorization** to find the GCF, and how that can help us **simplify fractions**. These aren‚Äôt just number tricks ‚Äî they help you write expressions in cleaner, simpler ways so they‚Äôre easier to work with.

## üî• Warm-Up

1. List the prime factorization of:

   a. 20
   b. 45

2. What‚Äôs the largest number that divides **both** 12 and 18 evenly?

3. Write a fraction equal to $\frac{12}{20}$ using smaller numbers.

### 1.3.1 ‚Äì What Is the Greatest Common Factor?

The **greatest common factor (GCF)** is the **biggest number** that divides evenly into *two or more* numbers.

Let‚Äôs look at 18 and 24.

Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
The GCF is **6** ‚Äî it‚Äôs the largest factor they both share.

### 1.3.2 ‚Äì Use Prime Factorization to Find the GCF

We can also find the GCF using **prime factorization**.

Let‚Äôs try 36 and 60.

Prime factorization:
36 = 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 3
60 = 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 5

The GCF is the product of the **shared prime factors**:
2 √ó 2 √ó 3 = **12**

This method works even when the numbers are large or hard to list out.

### 1.3.3 ‚Äì Simplifying Fractions with the GCF

Let‚Äôs say you have the fraction $\frac{36}{60}$.
Both numbers share a GCF of **12**, so:

$$
\frac{36 \div 12}{60 \div 12} = \frac{3}{5}
$$

You‚Äôve **simplified** the fraction ‚Äî but it still means the same thing.

This is called an **equivalent fraction**.

You *can* simplify step-by-step, but using the **GCF** gets the job done in **one move**.

### 1.3.4 ‚Äì Real-World Example

Suppose you‚Äôre planning gift bags.
You have **60 pencils** and **36 erasers** and want to make **identical bags** with no extras.

What‚Äôs the most you can make?

> Find the GCF of 60 and 36 ‚Üí **12**

You can make **12 bags**, each with:
60 √∑ 12 = 5 pencils
36 √∑ 12 = 3 erasers
