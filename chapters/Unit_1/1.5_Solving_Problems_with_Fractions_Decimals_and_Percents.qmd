# 1.5 ‚Äì Solving Problems with Fractions, Decimals & Percents {.unnumbered}

Now that you know how to convert between fractions, decimals, and percents, it's time to put that knowledge to work! In this lesson, you'll solve real-world problems involving discounts, grades, part-whole relationships, and more.

## üî• Warm-Up

1. You scored 40 out of 50 on a quiz. What percent is that?

2. What number is 25% of 60?

3. Is 0.6 greater than $\frac{2}{3}$? Explain how you know.

4. Write 0.8, $\frac{3}{4}$, and 75% in order from least to greatest.

## üë• Learn Together

### 1.5.1 ‚Äì What is ‚ÄúPercent of a Number‚Äù?

When you see a phrase like **"What is 25% of 80?"**, you‚Äôre really being asked to find a part of a whole. ‚ÄúOf‚Äù usually means **multiply**.

$$
25\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20
$$

You can also write this as a fraction:

$$
\frac{25}{100} \times 80 = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
$$

---

### 1.5.2 ‚Äì Finding the Percent

Sometimes we know the part and the whole, and want to know what **percent** that part is.

> You got 21 questions right out of 25. What percent is that?

$$
\frac{21}{25} = 0.84 \Rightarrow 84\%
$$

So you got an 84%!

---

### 1.5.3 ‚Äì Percent Problems in Reverse

What if we know the part and the percent, and want to find the whole?

> 30 is 10% of what number?

Set it up like this:

$$
0.10 \times \text{(whole)} = 30 \Rightarrow \text{whole} = \frac{30}{0.10} = 300
$$

Or write an equation:

$$
10\% \times x = 30 \Rightarrow x = 300
$$

### 1.5.4 ‚Äì Practical Examples

Here are some common situations where you‚Äôll use these ideas:

---

#### üõçÔ∏è Discounts

> A backpack costs $45. It‚Äôs 20% off. What is the sale price?

1. Find the discount:
   $$0.20 \times 45 = 9$$

2. Subtract from original price:
   $$45 - 9 = 36$$

The sale price is **$36**.

---

#### üéì Grades

> You scored 85%, 92%, and 78% on three tests. What is your average?

Add the scores and divide by 3:

$$
\frac{85 + 92 + 78}{3} = \frac{255}{3} = 85
$$

Your average is **85%**.

---

#### üßæ Tips and Tax

> A restaurant bill is $48. You want to leave a 15% tip. How much is the tip?

$$
0.15 \times 48 = 7.20
$$

Tip: **$7.20**

## ‚úçÔ∏è Practice On Your Own

### **Percent Word Problems**

1. What is 40% of 120?

2. A phone costs $300 and is marked down by 25%. What is the sale price?

3. You score 7 out of 10 on a quiz. What percent is that?

4. A student answered 42 out of 56 questions correctly. What percent is that?

5. 16 is 20% of what number?

6. What number is 150% of 12?

### **Mixed Review**

7. Write each value in all three forms (fraction, decimal, percent):

   a. One-half  
   b. 0.25  
   c. 75%

8. Order these from least to greatest:  
   0.3, 33%, $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{3}{10}$

9. Which is greater: $\frac{4}{5}$ or 85%?

10. A test is worth 60 points. You score 51. What percent did you get?

---

### **Challenge Problems**

11. A shirt originally costs $40. It‚Äôs discounted by 20%, then another 15% off the reduced price. What‚Äôs the final price?

12. A student gets 18 out of 20 on one test, 27 out of 30 on another, and 42 out of 50 on the final. What is their overall percent average?
