# 1.1 Integers & Number Lines {.unnumbered}

Did you know that all of mathematics is actually built up from simple things like counting? Even advanced topics like algebra and calculus are just clever ways of organizing and extending basic ideas — like moving forward and backward on a number line.

In this lesson, we’ll use the number line not just to count, but to add, subtract, and compare positive and negative numbers. That might sound basic, but it’s the foundation of nearly everything else you’ll do in Algebra.

Negative numbers can be tricky, especially when the rules don’t always match what your gut tells you. But if you can master the way they work on the number line — including things like opposites, absolute value, and comparison — you’ll be setting yourself up for success in the rest of the course.

### 1.1.1 The Number Line Is More Than Just Counting

You already know how to count — $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, and so on. The **number line** extends that idea in both directions.


**Let’s draw a number line from $-10$ to $10$**
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/blank_numberline.png)

Here, every tick mark is an {{< glink integer >}} — a whole number.

- Numbers to the **right** of zero are **positive**
- Numbers to the **left** of zero are **negative**

We can use this number line to *see* what happens when we add, subtract, or compare numbers.

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 How many numbers are between $3$ and $5$?"}

The answer is not $2$! There are infinitely many numbers between $3$ and $5$. Here are two number lines that might help convince you.

### 1.1.2 Understanding Opposites

Let’s look at a pair of numbers, $3$ and $-3$.

These are called {{< glink opposite >}} numbers. They are the **same distance** from zero but on **opposite sides** of it.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/opposites.png)

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 What is the opposite of zero?"}

The opposite of zero is zero. Zero is the only number that is its own opposite!
:::

### 1.1.3 What Is Absolute Value?

{{< glink Absolute value >}} ($|x|$) measures the **distance from zero**, no matter the direction.

Take a look at the number $-5$. The number line shows that it's absolute value is $5$ because it is $5$ units away from zero.
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/absolute_value_negative_five.png)


You can see that $|5|$ is also $5$ for the same reason!
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/absolute_value_five.png)

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Can the absolute value ever be negative?"}

Absolute value is **never** negative, because distance is never negative.

### 1.1.4 Comparing Integers

We can also use the number line to compare values. 

Let’s compare $2$ to $-7$.
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/compare_2_to_neg7.png)

Ask yourself:

* Which number is farther **to the right**?
* Which number is **closer to 0**?
* Does absolute value change the comparison?

You can see from the number line that $2 > -7$ because $2$ is to the right of $-7$.  But $|-7|>|2|$, that is $-7$ has a greater {{< glink absolute value >}} than $2$ because $-7$ is further from zero.

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Try comparing $3$ to $-8$ using a number line."}
$3 > -8$ because it is further to the right but $|-8|>|3|$ because $-8$ is further from zero.

### 1.1.5 Number Lines and Arithmetic

We can also use the number line to model **adding and subtracting** integers.

* To **add a positive number**, move **right**
* To **add a negative number**, move **left**


Examples:

1. Addition: $-2 + 6 = 4$
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/add_6_to_neg2.png)

2. Subtraction: $4 - 7 = -3$ 
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/subtract_7_from_4.png)

3. Adding a negative: $2 + (-5) = -3$
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/add_neg5_to_2.png)

4. Subtracting a negative: $2 - (-3) = 5$
![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_1/subtract_neg3_from_2.png)

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Can You think of a real-world example of each of these?"}

1. You are \$$2$ in debt and earn \$$6$, now you have \$$4$.
2. You have \$$4$ and spend \$$7$. You are now \$$3$ in debt.
3. You have \$$2$, the bank adds a \$$5$ fee to your account. You now owe \$$3$.
4. You have \$$2$, the bank forgives a \$$3$ overdraft fee. You now have \$$5$.

Would you like this exported as Quarto `.qmd` with stylized headings, tooltips, and number line placeholders? I can also start wiring in your plotting code or build a `.py` helper file with reusable number line functions if you want this production-ready.
