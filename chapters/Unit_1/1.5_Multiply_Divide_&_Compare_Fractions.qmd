# 1.5 ‚Äì Multiplying & Dividing Fractions {.unnumbered}

So far, we‚Äôve been learning how to compare and convert between fractions, decimals, and percents. But to actually solve real-world problems ‚Äî like finding totals, discounts, grades, or recipe amounts ‚Äî we also need to know how to **multiply and divide** with these numbers.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn how to multiply and divide fractions and mixed numbers. We‚Äôll explore why multiplying fractions is actually simpler than it seems, and why dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by something called a {{< glink reciprocal >}}. These skills will help prepare you for solving percent problems and other real-world applications in the next lesson.

## üî• Warm-Up

1. What is half of a half?

2. How many fourths are in 1 whole?

3. Predict: What do you think happens when you multiply two numbers less than 1?

4. If you divide 1 by $\frac{1}{2}$, what kind of number do you expect to get ‚Äî smaller or larger?

### 1.5.1 ‚Äì Multiplying Fractions

Multiplying by a fraction **divides** things into parts and takes a certain number of them. 

So when you multiply one fraction by another, you're just finding a fraction of a fraction ‚Äî or a **part of a part**.

**Example 1:** What is $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2}$?

Remember, in math, the word **"of"** often means multiplication.  
So this question is really asking:

> What is **one-fourth of one-half**?

Let‚Äôs look at a picture to show what this means:

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_5/fourth_of_a_half.png)

The circle is divided into 8 equal pieces:  
- The **right half** is light gray.  
- The **left half** is dark gray.  
- One small slice on the left is **blue**.

That blue slice shows **one-fourth of the dark half** ‚Äî or one-fourth of one-half.  
Since there are 8 total pieces and only 1 is blue, the answer is $\frac{1}{8}$ of the whole.

But drawing pictures every time would take too long.  
We can take a shortcut by multiplying the numerators and denominators:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 1}{4 \times 2} = \frac{1}{8}
$$

:::{.callout-caution title="There is no denominator!"}
Not to worry! If there is no denominator we just make it 1. That's because dividing by 1 does not change the value of the number, it just changes the way it looks.

**Example 2:**

$$
3 \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{1} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{6}{5}
$$

:::

**Example 3:** What is $\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9}{4}$?

We proceed in the same way. Multiplying numerators and denominators together:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9}{4} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3 \times 4} = \frac{18}{12}
$$

But wait! That fraction isn't in simplest form! We should always simplify our fractions when possible. So the answer is:


$$
\frac{18}{12}
= \frac{\color{red}{\cancel{2}} \times 3 \times \color{red}{\cancel{3}}}{\color{red}{\cancel{2}} \times \color{red}{\cancel{3}} \times 2}
= \frac{3}{2}
$$


:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="üß† Your turn! What is $\frac{5}{8} \times \frac{3}{4}$?"}

 $$
\frac{5}{8} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5 \times 3}{8 \times 4} = \frac{15}{32}
$$

### 1.5.2 ‚Äì Multiplying Mixed Numbers

A {{< glink mixed number >}} is a number that has a whole part and a fraction part, like $4\tfrac{2}{3}$.
Before multiplying, we first need to turn it into an {{< glink improper fraction >}}, which is a fraction greater than 1.

**Why?**
We can‚Äôt multiply properly until we know how many total parts we're dealing with ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what improper fractions show.


**Example:**
Multiply $4\tfrac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{6}$

Step 1: Turn the mixed number into an improper fraction.

We need to figure out how many thirds we have. To do that, multiply the whole number by the denominator:

$$
4 \times 3 = 12
$$

Then add the numerator:

$$
12 + 2 = 14
$$

This tells us how many parts we have.
So:

$$
4\tfrac{2}{3} = \frac{14}{3}
$$

Step 2: Multiply the fractions.

$$
\frac{14}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{28}{9}
$$

**How do we convert back to a mixed number?**

First, **divide**: 

$$
28 \div 9 = 3 \text{ remainder 1}
$$

Then **add**: 

$$
3 + \frac{1}{9} = 3\frac{1}{9}
$$

---

**Another Example:**
Multiply $2\tfrac{1}{4} \times \frac{4}{5}$

Step 1: Convert the mixed number.

$$
2 \times 4 = 8,\quad 8 + 1 = 9 \Rightarrow 2\tfrac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4}
$$

Step 2: Multiply:

$$
\frac{9}{4} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{36}{20} = \frac{9}{5} = 1\frac{4}{5}
$$


:::{.callout-tip .realworld-box icon=false title="üåç In the Real World"}
Mixed numbers show up very frequently in cooking. For example, a recipe may call for $3 \frac{1}{2}$ cups of sugar. What if we want to cut the recipe in half?  To do that, we need to multiply:

$$
3 \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{4} \text{ cups}
$$

Who wants to use a $\frac{1}{4}$ cup scoop 7 times? To save time, we convert back to a mixed number:

$$
\frac{7}{4} => 7 \div 4 = 1 \text{ remainder 3} => 1\frac{3}{4} \text{cups}
$$

### 1.5.3 ‚Äì Division & Reciprocals

Dividing fractions can seem strange ‚Äî until you understand the **reciprocal**.

The **reciprocal** of a number is what you multiply by to get 1. For example:

- The reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{3}$
- The reciprocal of $5$ is $\frac{1}{5}$

To **divide fractions**, we multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor:

**Example:**
$$
\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{8}{3}
$$

Why does this work?

Dividing by $\frac{1}{4}$ asks: *How many fourths are in two-thirds?*

Visualizing it:
- Each ‚Äúfourth‚Äù is a small slice.
- You‚Äôre seeing how many of those slices fit in your amount.

:::{.callout-tip title="When in doubt: Keep, Change, Flip"}

A common trick for dividing fractions:

1. **Keep** the first fraction.
2. **Change** the division sign to multiplication.
3. **Flip** the second fraction (use the reciprocal).
