# 1.5 ‚Äì Multiplying & Dividing Fractions {.unnumbered}

In previous lessons, you've learned how fractions, decimals, and percents relate to each other. But to solve real-world problems‚Äîlike adjusting recipes, calculating discounts, or determining grades‚Äîyou also need to multiply and divide these numbers.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn how to multiply and divide fractions and mixed numbers. We‚Äôll explore why multiplying fractions is actually simpler than it seems, and why dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by something called a {{< glink reciprocal >}}. These skills will help you tackle percent problems and practical applications in upcoming lessons.

## üî• Warm-Up

1. What is half of a half?

2. How many fourths are in one whole?

3. Predict: What happens when you multiply two numbers that are smaller than 1?

4. If you divide 1 by $\frac{1}{2}$, will the anser be bigger or smaller?

### 1.5.1 ‚Äì Multiplying Fractions

Multiplying by a fraction means finding a fraction **of** something else. In other words, you're finding a **part of a part**.

**Example:** $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2}$

This means:

> **one-fourth of one-half**

Here is what it looks like to find how many fourths are in one half:

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_5/fourth_of_a_half.png)

That blue slice shows one of the four parts of the darker half.  
Since there are 8 total pieces, and only 1 is blue, the answer is $\frac{1}{8}$ of the whole.

Drawing pie charts every time we multiply would take forever‚Äîso here's the shortcut:

- Multiply numerators together.
- Multiply denominators together.
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 1}{4 \times 2} = \frac{1}{8}
$$

:::{.you-try title="$\frac{3}{5} \times \frac{4}{7}$"}
$$
\frac{3}{5} \times \frac{4}{7} = \frac{3 \times 4}{5 \times 7} = \frac{12}{35}
$$

#### **Multipying Whole Numbers by Fractions**

No denominator? No problem! Just put a 1 underneath:

**Example:** $3 \times \frac{2}{5}$
$$
3 \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{\color{red}1} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{6}{5}
$$

:::{.you-try title="$5 \times \frac{3}{4}$"}
$$
5 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{\color{red}1} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5 \times 3}{1 \times 4} = \frac{15}{4}
$$
:::

#### **Simplifying After Multiplying**

The smaller the numbers are, the easier they are to work with. Always simplify fractions when you can.

**Example:** $\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9}{4}$
$$
\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9}{4} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3 \times 4} = \frac{18}{12}
$$
Cancel out any common factors:
$$
\frac{18}{12}
= \frac{\cancel{\color{red}2} \times 3 \times \cancel{\color{red}3}}{\cancel{\color{red}2} \times \cancel{\color{red}3} \times 2}
= \frac{3}{2}
$$

:::{.callout-tip}
If you factor before you multiply, you get to skip a step.
$$
\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9}{4} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3 \times 4} = \frac{\cancel{\color{red}2} \times (3 \times \cancel{\color{red}3})}{\cancel{\color{red}3}  \times (\cancel{\color{red}2} \times 2)}
= \frac{3}{2}
$$
:::

:::{.you-try title="$\frac{8}{9} \times \frac{3}{4}$"}
$$
\frac{8}{9} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8 \times 3}{9 \times 4} = \frac{(\cancel{\color{red}2} \times \cancel{\color{red}2} \times 2) \times \cancel{\color{red}3}}{(\cancel{\color{red}3} \times 3) \times (\cancel{\color{red}2} \times \cancel{\color{red}2})} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

### 1.5.2 ‚Äì Multiplying Mixed Numbers

A {{< glink mixed number >}} is a number that has a whole part and a fraction part, like $4\tfrac{2}{3}$.
Before multiplying, we first need to convert to an {{< glink improper fraction >}}.


**Example:**
Multiply $4\tfrac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{6}$

We have 2 thirds, but how many thirds are in 4? To find out, multiply the whole number by the denominator:
$$
4 \times 3 = 12
$$
Then add the numerator:
$$
12 + 2 = 14
$$
Now we know that there are 14 thirds.
$$
4\tfrac{2}{3} = \frac{14}{3}
$$
Now we are ready to multiply:
$$
\frac{14}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{28}{9}
$$
Sometimes we need to **convert back** to a mixed number. Here is how we do that:

First, **divide**: 
$$
28 \div 9 = 3 \text{ remainder 1}
$$
Now we know we have 3 wholes and 1 remaining ninth. Together that is $3 \tfrac{1}{9}$.

---

**Another Example:** $2\tfrac{1}{4} \times \frac{4}{5}$

Step 1: Convert the mixed number.
$$
2 \times 4 = 8,\quad 8 + 1 = 9 \Rightarrow 2\tfrac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4}
$$
Step 2: Multiply:
$$
\frac{9}{4} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{9 \times \cancel{\color{red}4}}{\cancel{\color{red}4} \times 5} = \frac{9}{5} = 1\frac{4}{5}
$$

:::{.real-world}
Mixed numbers show up often, especially in cooking. If a recipe for 12 needs $3 \frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour, and we only want half (for 6 servings), we multiply:
$$
3 \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{4}
$$
Instead of measuring 7 times with a $\frac{1}{4}$ cup, convert back to a mixed number:
$$
\frac{7}{4} = 1\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups}
$$
:::

:::{.you-try title="$3 \tfrac{2}{3} \times 4 \tfrac{1}{2}$"}
$$
3 \tfrac{2}{3} \times 4 \tfrac{1}{8} = \frac{11}{3} \times \frac{9}{2} = \frac{11 \times (\cancel{\color{red}3} \times 3)}{\cancel{\color{red}3} \times 2} = \frac{33}{2} = 8 \frac{1}{2}
$$

### 1.5.3 ‚Äì Division & Reciprocals

Dividing fractions? Easy‚Äîmeet the {{< glink reciprocal >}}. It flips fractions upside down!

 - Reciprocal of  $\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{3}$
 - Reciprocal of 5 is $\frac{1}{5}$


To divide fractions, multiply by the reciprocal of the {{< glink divisor >}}:

**Example:** $\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{4}$
$$
\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{8}{3}
$$
Dividing by  asks, "How many fourths are there in $\frac{2}{3}$?"

---

:::{.remember title="Keep, Change, Flip"}

Dividing fractions is as easy as 1-2-3:

1. **Keep** the first fraction.
2. **Change** the division sign to multiplication.
3. **Flip** the second fraction (use the reciprocal).
