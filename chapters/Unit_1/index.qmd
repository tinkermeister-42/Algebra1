# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Unit 1! This is where you’ll build your Algebra toolkit — skills like working with integers, simplifying fractions, and following the order of operations.

You’ll use these tools again and again to solve expressions, equations, and real-world problems throughout the year.

## What You’ll Learn

By the end of this unit, you’ll be able to:

* Work with positive and negative numbers on a number line  
* Use factor trees to find prime factorizations  
* Identify and use the greatest common factor (GCF)  
* Convert between fractions, decimals, and percents  
* Multiply, divide, and compare fractions
* Solve real-world problems using fractions, decimals, and percents
* Follow the correct order of operations to simplify expressions
