# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Unit 1! In this unit, we’ll build the foundation you need to succeed in Algebra. Think of this as preparing your math toolkit.

You’ll explore integers, factors, fractions, and the rules of simplification. These skills are the building blocks that will help you solve more complex problems with confidence — especially when working with expressions and equations in later units.

## What You’ll Learn

By the end of this unit, you’ll be able to:

* Work with positive and negative numbers on a number line
* Use factor trees to find prime factorizations
* Identify and use the greatest common factor (GCF)
* Convert between fractions, decimals, and percents
* Multiply, divide, and compare fractions
* Follow the correct order of operations to simplify expressions
