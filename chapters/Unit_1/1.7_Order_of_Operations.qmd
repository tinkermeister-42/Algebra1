# 1.7 ‚Äì Order of Operations {.unnumbered}

What does this equal?

$$
6 + 2 \times 3
$$

If you said 24, you're not alone‚Äîbut that's not the correct answer. Math has specific rules for what to do first. These rules are called the {{< glink order of operations >}}, and they help make sure everyone simplifies {{< glink expressions >}} the same way.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to follow those rules correctly‚Äîeven when negatives, fractions, and grouping symbols are involved.

### 1.7.1 ‚Äì The Order Matters

In math, the order you do things **really matters** ‚Äî doing steps out of order can completely change the answer.

Take this simple-looking problem:

$$
10 + 3 \times 5
$$

Let‚Äôs try solving it from **left to right**:

$$
\color{red}10 + 3 \color{black}\times 5 = \color{red}13 \color{black}\times 5 = 65
$$

Now let‚Äôs try doing the **multiplication first**:

$$
10 + \color{red}3 \times 5 \color{black} = 10 + \color{red}15 \color{black} = 25
$$

So which one is correct ‚Äî **65 or 25**?

‚úÖ The correct answer is **25**, because we follow a specific order of {{< glink operations >}}. Without these rules, people could get different answers to the same problem!

Let‚Äôs look at the rules:

:::{.remember title="The Order of Operations"}

We often remember the order using **PEMDAS**:

* **P** ‚Äì Parentheses $(...)$
* **E** ‚Äì Exponents (like $3^2$)
* **M/D** ‚Äì Multiplication ($\times$) and Division ($\div$)
* **A/S** ‚Äì Addition ($+$) and Subtraction ($-$)

**Note:**

- Multiplication and division are on the **same level**. Do them **left to right**.
- The same goes for addition and subtraction.

You can think of it like a ladder. You start at the top and climb your way down!

:::

:::{.think title="Why are multiplication and division grouped together?"}

Because they are **two sides of the same operation**.
Any division problem can be rewritten as multiplication by using the **reciprocal**.

> **Example:** $12 \div \frac{3}{2}$
> becomes
> $12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8$

The same is true for addition and subtraction. Subtraction is really just adding the opposite.

> **Example:** $5 - 2$
> becomes
> $5 + (-2) = 3$

### 1.7.2 ‚Äì Examples with Integers

Let‚Äôs look at some {{< glink expressions >}} that follow the order of operations. These use only whole numbers ‚Äî no fractions or negatives yet.


**Example 1:** $5 + 3 \times 2$

First, do the multiplication:

$$
5 + \color{red}3 \times 2 \color{black} = 5 + \color{red}6
$$

Then do the addition:

$$
5 + 6 = 11
$$

---

**Example 2:** $(5 + 3) \times 2$

First, simplify the parentheses:

$$
\color{red}(5 + 3) \color{black} \times 2 = \color{red}8 \color{black} \times 2
$$

Then multiply:

$$
8 \times 2 = 16
$$

---

**Example 3:** $8 - 12 \div 3$

First, divide:

$$
8 - \color{red}12 \div 3 \color{black} = 8 - \color{red}4
$$

Then subtract:

$$
8 - 4 = 4
$$

---

:::{.you-try title="$5(8 - 1) + 2 \times 3$"}

Start with parentheses:
$$
5\color{red}(8 - 1)\color{black} + 2 \times 3 = 5 \times \color{red}7 \color{black} + 2 \times 3
$$
Next, do the multiplication:
$$
\color{red}5 \times 7 \color{black} + \color{red}2 \times 3 \color{black} = \color{red}35 \color{black} + \color{red}6
$$
Finally, add:
$$
35 + 6 = 41
$$

### 1.7.3 ‚Äì With Negatives and Fractions

Once you're comfortable with the basics, we can add in **negative numbers** and **fractions**. The order of operations still works the same way ‚Äî you just have to be more careful.


**Example 1:** $-3 \times (4 - 7)$

First, simplify the parentheses:

$$
-3 \times \color{red}(4 - 7)\color{black} = -3 \times \color{red}-3
$$

Then multiply. Remember: a **negative times a negative is positive**.

$$
-3 \times -3 = 9
$$

:::{.think title="Why is a negative times a negative positive?"}

What does multiplying by a negative number do?  
It **reverses the sign** of the number it‚Äôs multiplied by.

**Example:**  
$3 \times -1 = -3$ ‚Üí the positive 3 becomes negative

Now try it with a negative number:

**Example:**  
$-3 \times -1 = 3$ ‚Üí the negative 3 becomes positive

So multiplying by $-1$ always gives the **opposite sign**.  
That‚Äôs why $-3 \times -1 = 3$ ‚Äî the opposite of negative 3 is positive 3.

:::


---

**Example 2:** $\frac{1}{2} \times (6 + 2)$

First, simplify the parentheses:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \color{red}(6 + 2)\color{black} = \frac{1}{2} \times \color{red}8
$$

Then multiply:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 8 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{8}{1} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

---

**Example 3:** $\frac{3 + 5}{2}$

This fraction means to divide **after** you do the work on top.

Even though there are no parentheses, the **fraction bar acts like grouping symbols** ‚Äî just like parentheses.

So:

$$
\frac{\color{red}{3 + 5}}{2} = \frac{\color{red}{8}}{2} = 4
$$

---

::: {.you-try title="$-3 \times (4 - 7)$"}

First do the parentheses:
$$
-3 \times \color{red}(4 - 7) \color{black} = -3 \times \color{red}{-3}
$$
Then multiply:
$$
-3 \times -3 = 9
$$
:::

---

### 1.7.4 ‚Äì More Complex Expressions

Let‚Äôs try putting all the steps together. When expressions involve grouping, exponents, fractions, and multiple operations, PEMDAS really helps keep things organized.


**Example:**  $4 + \frac{1}{2} \times (6 - 2)^2$


**Step 1:** Parentheses  
$$
4 + \frac{1}{2} \times \color{red}{(6 - 2)}^{\color{black}2} \color{black} = 4 + \frac{1}{2} \times \color{red}{4}\color{black}^{2}
$$


**Step 2:** Exponents  
$$
4 + \frac{1}{2} \times \color{red}{4^2}\color{black} = 4 + \frac{1}{2} \times \color{red}{16}
$$


**Step 3:** Multiplication
$$
4 + \color{red}{\frac{1}{2} \times 16}\color{black} = 4 + \color{red}{8}
$$


**Step 4:** Addition
$$
\color{red}{4 + 8}\color{black} = 12
$$


:::{.think title="Why are parentheses so important here?"}

Without parentheses, you might square the wrong number. Always follow PEMDAS and work **inside parentheses first** ‚Äî especially when there are **multiple layers**.

:::

::: {.gotcha title="Be careful with negatives!"}

$-3^2$ means $-(3^2)$, which is:
$$
-(3^2) = -9
$$
But $(-3)^2$ means the negative is part of the base:
$$
(-3)^2 = 9
$$
:::

---

### Nested Parentheses

Sometimes, expressions use **more than one layer of grouping**. When that happens:

- Always work **from the inside out**
- Brackets $[\,]$ or braces $\{\,\}$ might be used to help keep things clear

---

**Example:**  
$$
\left[ 3 + (2^2 + 1) \right] \times 2
$$

---

**Step 1: Inner parentheses**  
$$
\left[ 3 + \color{red}{(2^2 + 1)} \color{black}\right] \times 2 = \left[ 3 + \color{red}{5} \right] \times 2
$$

---

**Step 2: Brackets**  
$$
\color{red}{\left[ 3 + 5 \right]} \color{black} \times 2 = \color{red}{8} \color{black} \times 2
$$

---

**Step 3: Multiply**  
$$
\color{red}{8 \times 2} \color{black} = 16
$$

---

::: {.remember  title="What counts as grouping?"}

PEMDAS starts with **grouping**, and that means more than just parentheses!

These all group parts of an expression:

- $(...)$ ‚Äî parentheses
- $[\,]$ or $\{\,\}$ ‚Äî brackets/braces (used for nesting)
- Fraction bars $\frac{a}{b}$
- Square roots $\sqrt{a + b}$

Always simplify **grouped expressions** before applying exponents or multiplying.

:::

::: {.you-try title="$\left[ 5 + (3^2 - 1) \right] \times 2$"}

**Step 1: Inner parentheses**  
$$
\left[ 5 + \color{red}{(3^2 - 1)} \right] \times 2 = \left[ 5 + \color{red}{8} \right] \times 2
$$
**Step 2: Brackets**  
$$
\color{red}{\left[ 5 + 8 \right]} \color{black} \times 2 = \color{red}{13} \color{black} \times 2
$$
**Step 3: Multiply**  
$$
\color{red}{13 \times 2} \color{black} = 26
$$
‚úÖ Final Answer: **26**

### 1.7.5 ‚Äì Why This Matters

This might feel like just number-crunching, but it lays the foundation for Algebra. You‚Äôll need these skills to simplify expressions, solve equations, and understand formulas.

Later in Algebra, you‚Äôll see variables, combining like terms, and the distributive property. If you can‚Äôt simplify numbers correctly, the rest will fall apart.

:::{.real-world title="Coupons and Gift Cards"}
You get a 25% off coupon and a $10 gift card. The item costs $40.

Which should be applied first?

* 25% off first ‚Üí $40 √ó 0.75 = $30 ‚Üí $30 - $10 = **$20**
* Gift card first ‚Üí $40 - $10 = $30 ‚Üí 25% off = $22.50

Same ingredients, different result. Order matters!
