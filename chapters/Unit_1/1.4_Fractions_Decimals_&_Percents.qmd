# 1.4 ‚Äì Fractions, Decimals & Percents {.unnumbered}

Fractions, decimals, and percents are just different ways of showing the same thing ‚Äî a part of a whole. Whether you‚Äôre splitting a pizza, measuring a distance, or shopping during a sale, these numbers are everywhere.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn how to move between these forms and understand how they relate to each other. We'll build on what you already know about simplifying fractions to make conversions easier.

### 1.4.1 ‚Äì What Are Fractions, Decimals, and Percents?

Fractions, decimals, and percents are all ways of showing a **part of a whole**.

- A **fraction** shows how many parts out of a total (e.g. $\frac{2}{5}$ = 2 out of 5 equal parts).
- A **decimal** uses place value and powers of 10 (e.g. 0.4 = 4 tenths).
- A **percent** means ‚Äúper 100‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a fraction with a denominator of 100 (e.g. 25% = $\frac{25}{100}$).

Let‚Äôs look at one example in all three forms:

| Name     | Example       | Meaning              |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Fraction | $\frac{1}{2}$ | 1 out of 2 parts     |
| Decimal  | 0.5           | 5 tenths             |
| Percent  | 50%           | 50 out of 100 parts  |

These are all {{< glink equivalent >}} ‚Äì they mean the same thing, just written in different ways.

---

**Here‚Äôs another example:**

All of the following represent the same value: $\frac{2}{5}$ = 0.4 = 40%.

![Fraction grid showing the fraction $\frac{2}{5}$](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/fraction_2_fifths.png){fig-alt="A grid with $\frac{2}{5}$ of the boxes shaded" width=33%}

![Pie chart highlighting 40%](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/pie_chart_40_percent.png){fig-alt="A pie chart with 40% taken out." width=50%}

![Number line with 0.4 marked](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/linechart_point_4.png){fig-alt="Number line with a point at 0.4" width=100%}


Each image shows a **part of a whole** in a different way ‚Äî but they all represent the same quantity.

### 1.4.2 ‚Äì Converting Fractions to Decimals

To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator.

Let‚Äôs try:

$$
\frac{3}{4} = 3 \div 4 = 0.75
$$

Use a calculator if needed!

Try these:

* $\frac{1}{2} = 1 \div 2 = \_\_\_$
* $\frac{2}{5} = 2 \div 5 = \_\_\_$
* $\frac{1}{8} = 1 \div 8 = \_\_\_$

Some fractions turn into decimals that **stop** (terminate), and some **repeat forever**.

| Fraction        | Decimal  |
| --------------- | -------- |
| $\frac{1}{4}$ | 0.25     |
| $\frac{1}{3}$ | 0.333... |
| $\frac{2}{3}$ | 0.666... |
| $\frac{1}{5}$ | 0.2      |

If the decimal repeats, we write a bar over the repeating part:
$\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}$

---

### 1.4.3 ‚Äì Converting Decimals to Percents

To turn a decimal into a percent, multiply by 100 (move the decimal two places right) and add a percent sign:

* $0.5 \rightarrow 50%$
* $0.75 \rightarrow 75%$
* $0.08 \rightarrow 8%$

**Try this:**
What percent is 0.6?

> $0.6 \times 100 = 60%$

---

### 1.4.4 ‚Äì Converting Percents to Decimals and Fractions

To convert a percent to a decimal, divide by 100 (move the decimal two places left):

* $75% \rightarrow 0.75$
* $20% \rightarrow 0.20$
* $5% \rightarrow 0.05$

To write it as a fraction, think of the percent as ‚Äúout of 100,‚Äù then simplify if possible:

* $75% = \frac{75}{100} = \frac{3}{4}$
* $20% = \frac{20}{100} = \frac{1}{5}$
* $5% = \frac{5}{100} = \frac{1}{20}$

:::{.callout-note icon=false title="üí° Tip"}
If the percent ends in a 0 or 5, it often simplifies nicely as a fraction.

### 1.4.5 ‚Äì Using a Conversion Triangle

Here‚Äôs a quick triangle you can draw to help you remember how to switch between all three forms.

```
     Fraction
     /      \
    /        \
Decimal <‚Äì‚Äì> Percent
```

* **Fraction ‚Üí Decimal**: divide top √∑ bottom
* **Decimal ‚Üí Percent**: √ó 100
* **Percent ‚Üí Decimal**: √∑ 100
* **Fraction ‚Üí Percent**: Convert to decimal first, then multiply by 100

### 1.4.6 ‚Äì Benchmark Values

Some conversions are so common that it helps to **memorize** them. These are called **benchmark values**:

| Fraction         | Decimal  | Percent |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- |
| $\frac{1}{2}$  | 0.5      | 50%     |
| $\frac{1}{4}$  | 0.25     | 25%     |
| $\frac{3}{4}$  | 0.75     | 75%     |
| $\frac{1}{3}$  | 0.333... | 33.3%   |
| $\frac{2}{3}$  | 0.666... | 66.6%   |
| $\frac{1}{5}$  | 0.2      | 20%     |
| $\frac{1}{10}$ | 0.1      | 10%     |
