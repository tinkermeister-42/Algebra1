# 1.4 ‚Äì Fractions, Decimals & Percents: Conversions {.unnumbered}

Fractions, decimals, and percents are just different ways of showing the same thing ‚Äî a part of a whole. Whether you‚Äôre splitting a pizza, measuring a distance, or shopping during a sale, these numbers are everywhere.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn how to move between these forms and understand how they relate to each other. This will be an important skill for solving many types of problems that involve parts of a whole.

### 1.4.1 ‚Äì What Are Fractions, Decimals, and Percents?

Fractions, decimals, and percents are all ways of showing a **part of a whole**.

A **fraction** shows how many parts out of a total. We often use them when:

- Measuring ingredients: "Add $\frac{2}{3}$ of a cup of milk."
- Position in a ranking: "She ranked 2 out of 350 or $\frac{2}{350}$."
- Splitting or sharing something: "We each got $\frac{3}{8}$ of the pizza."

A **decimal** uses place value and powers of 10. Decimals can be used for:

- Dealing with money: "This costs $4.75."
- Measuring length or weight: "The board is 2.5 feet long."
- Reporting data or averages: "The average was 3.6 stars."

A **percent** means ‚Äúper 100‚Äù. Percents are used when:

- Talking about sales or discounts: "It's 20% off!"
- Describing test scores: "She got 95% on the quiz."
- Comparing populations or change: "Unemployment dropped by 2%."


We think about and visualize fractions, decimals, and percents differently too. Here is the same number shown in three different ways!


![The fraction $\frac{2}{5}$](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/fraction_2_fifths.png){fig-align=center fig-alt="A grid with $\frac{2}{5}$ of the boxes shaded" width=33%}


![The decimal 0.4](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/linechart_point_4.png){fig-align=center fig-alt="Number line with a point at 0.4" width=75%}


![The percentage 40%](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/pie_chart_40_percent.png){fig-align=center fig-alt="A pie chart with 40% taken out." width=50%}


Fractions, decimals, and percents all show the same thing in different ways. You can change one form into another. Choose the form that fits the situation. In the next sections, you‚Äôll learn how to switch between them.

### 1.4.2 ‚Äì Converting Fractions to Decimals

Have you ever wondered why the division symbol (&divide;) looks the way it does?  It has two dots separated by a bar because it represents a fraction! This is because fractions are just a different way to show division. To convert a fraction to a decimal, all we have to do is **divide** the numerator by the denominator.

Let‚Äôs try:

$$
\frac{3}{4} = 3 \div 4 = 0.75
$$


When we convert to a decimal, we will see that some decimals **end**, and some **repeat forever**.

| Fraction        | Decimal  |
| --------------- | -------- |
| $\frac{1}{4}$ | 0.25     |
| $\frac{1}{3}$ | 0.333... |
| $\frac{2}{3}$ | 0.666... |
| $\frac{1}{5}$ | 0.2      |

If the decimal repeats, we write a bar over the repeating part:
$\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}$


::: {.gotcha title="Repeating Decimals Aren‚Äôt Always Obvious"}

When you use a calculator to turn a fraction into a decimal, the result might look like it stops, but that can be misleading!

Some fractions have repeating decimals that go on forever ‚Äî but calculators round or cut them off.

For example:

$\frac{2}{3}$ really equals $0.\overline{6}$ (0.6666‚Ä¶) but your calculator might show 0.6666666667

This can cause small errors if you're not careful ‚Äî especially when comparing values or converting back to fractions.

üëâ Tip: If the decimal looks like it‚Äôs repeating (like 0.6666666667 or 0.14285714286...), it probably is!
:::


:::{.callout-tip title="What fractions have repeating decimals?"}

After you simplify the fraction, look at the denominator. If it‚Äôs made only from 2s and/or 5s (like 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20), the decimal ends. If it has any other factor (like 3 or 7), the decimal repeats.

**Example 1:**
 
The fraction $\frac{3}{10}$ has a denominator with factors 2 and 5. It ends and gives 0.3. 

**Example 2**

The fraction $\frac{2}{6}$ has a denominator with factors 2 and 3. It repeats and gives $0.\overline{3}$.

:::

:::{.you-try title="Write $\frac{2}{5}$ as a decimal."}

Using a calculator, we find that...
$$
\frac{2}{5} = 2 \div 5 = 0.4
$$
:::

### 1.4.3 - Converting Fractions and Decimals to Percents

Turning a decimal into a percent is easy. We simply move the decimal point to the right twice (the same as multiplying by 100) and then add a % sign.

**Example:** Convert 0.234 to a percent

To do this, we move the decimal two places to the right and then add a % sign. This gives us 23.4%. 

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/convert_point_234.png){height=50 fig-alt="Converting 0.234 to 23.4%"}

But what if there isn't a digit in the hundredths place? When we don't have enough digits to the right of the decimal, we just fill them in with zeros. 

**Example:** Convert 0.4 to a percent.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/convert_point_4.png){height=50 fig-alt="Converting 0.4 to 40%"}

But what if the number is bigger than 1? When the number is bigger than 1.0, we do exactly the same thing and end up with a percentage that is larger than 100%! 

**Example:** Convert 3.2 to a percent.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/convert_3_point_2.png){height=50 fig-alt="Converting 3.2 to 320%"}

:::{.you-try title="What is 1.342 as a percent?"}

We multiply by 100 (move the decimal to the right twice) and add a % sign. This gives...
$$1.342 \times 100 = 134.2\%$$
:::

---

To convert a fraction to a percent, we first convert the fraction to a decimal.

**Example:** Convert $\frac{3}{5}$ to a percent.

$$
\frac{3}{5} \Rightarrow 3 \div 5 = 0.6
$$

Now we convert the decimal to a percent.

$$0.6 \Rightarrow 60\%$$

:::{.you-try title="What is $\frac{2}{3}$ as a percent?"}
First convert to a decimal:
$$
\frac{2}{3} \Rightarrow 2 \div 3 = 0.\overline{6}
$$
Now convert to a percent:
$$
0.\overline{6} \Rightarrow 66.\overline{6}\%
$$
:::

### 1.4.4 Converting Decimals to Fractions

What if we want to go the other direction and convert a decimal to a fraction? The key to doing this is understanding {{< glink place value >}}. 

Suppose we have the number 123.456. The following table shows the place value for each digit.

| Place             | Value | Explanation                |
|-------------------|:-----:|-----------------------------|
| Hundreds          | 1     | 1 hundred = 100            |
| Tens              | 2     | 2 tens = 20                |
| Ones              | 3     | 3 ones = 3                 |
| **Decimal Point** |  .    | Separates whole from part  |
| Tenths            | 4     | 4 tenths = $\frac{4}{10}$  |
| Hundredths        | 5     | 5 hundredths = $\frac{5}{100}$ |
| Thousandths       | 6     | 6 thousandths = $\frac{6}{1000}$ |

Place value helps us say the number differently. Instead of saying "123 **point** 456" we could say "123 **and** 456 **thousandths**".  This is the trick to converting decimals to fractions.

**Example 1:**

Say we want to convert 0.75 to a fraction. We could say this is "zero **point** seven five" but it is more useful to say this is "75 hundredths". This gives us our fraction!

$$
0.75 = \text{75 hundredths} \Rightarrow \frac{75}{100} = \frac{3}{4}
$$


**Example 2**

Let's convert 0.1 into a fraction.

$$
0.1 = \text{1 tenth} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{10}
$$

**What if we have a number bigger than one?**

If the number is bigger than one (like we saw with 4.23) we do the same thing, but we end up with a {{< glink mixed number >}}.

$$
4.23 = \text{4 and 23 hundredths} \Rightarrow 4\dfrac{23}{100}
$$

:::{.callout-tip}
If you struggle with words like "hundredths" here is another way to think about it. To convert a decimal to a fraction, count the number of digits to the **right** of the decimal. You will divide by 1 with that many zeros after it.

**Example:** 0.5431

There are 4 digits to the right of the decimal point and so we divide by 1 with 4 zeros:
$$
0.5431 = \frac{5431}{10000}
$$
:::

:::{.you-try title="Write 0.51 as a fraction."}
$$
0.51 = \text{51 hundredths} \Rightarrow \frac{51}{100}
$$
:::

### 1.4.5 ‚Äì Converting Percents to Decimals and Fractions

To convert a percent to a decimal simply move the decimal two places left (the same as dividing by 100).

For example, here is what it looks like to convert 41% to a decimal. Notice that we sometimes have to add zeros to the left so the decimal has a place to go. Also notice that if there is no decimal, we put it just after the number before moving to the left.

![](/images/Unit_1/Lesson_4/convert_41_percent.png){height=50 fig-alt="Converting 41% to 0.41"}

Here are some more examples:

- 3.4% &rarr; 0.034

- 75% &rarr; 0.75

- 251% &rarr; 2.51

- 0.2% &rarr; 0.002


:::{.you-try title="What is 35% as a decimal?"}
We move the decimal to the left twice and remove the % sign. This gives...
$$
35\% = 0.35
$$
:::

To write a percent as a fraction, first convert to a decimal and then convert to a fraction, simplifying if possible:

- 3.4% &rarr; 0.034 &rarr; $\frac{34}{1000}$ &rarr; $\frac{17}{500}$

- 75% &rarr; 0.75 &rarr; $\frac{75}{100}$ &rarr; $\frac{3}{4}$

- 251% &rarr; 2.51 &rarr; $\frac{251}{100}$

- 0.2% &rarr; 0.002 &rarr; $\frac{2}{1000}$ &rarr; $\frac{1}{500}$

:::{.you-try title="What is 35% as a fraction?"}
First, convert to a decimal and then to a fraction.
$$
35\% = 0.35 \Rightarrow \text{35 hundredths} \Rightarrow \frac{35}{100} = \frac{7}{20}
$$

Now that you‚Äôve seen how to convert between fractions, decimals, and percents, here‚Äôs a summary table to help you remember the steps:

| From      |     To    | How to Convert                                                      |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Fraction |  Decimal  | Divide the numerator by the denominator                             |
|  Fraction |  Percent  | First convert to a decimal then convert to a percent                |
|  Decimal  |  Fraction | Use place value (write the fraction as you would say it)            |
|  Decimal  |  Percent  | Move the decimal two places right and add % sign                    |
|  Percent  |  Decimal  | Move the decimal two places left and remove % sign                  |
|  Percent  |  Fraction | First convert to a decimal and then convert to a fraction           |


:::{.remember}
Some conversions are so common that it helps to **memorize** them. These are called **benchmark values**:

| Fraction       | Decimal  | Percent |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- |
| $\frac{1}{2}$  | 0.5      | 50%     |
| $\frac{1}{4}$  | 0.25     | 25%     |
| $\frac{3}{4}$  | 0.75     | 75%     |
| $\frac{1}{3}$  | 0.333... | 33.3...%|
| $\frac{1}{5}$  | 0.2      | 20%     |
| $\frac{1}{8}$  | 0.125    | 12.5%   |
