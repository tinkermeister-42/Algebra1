# 1.4 – Fractions, Decimals & Percents {.unnumbered}

Did you know that ½, 0.5, and 50% are all the same amount?

In real life, we use **fractions**, **decimals**, and **percents** to describe parts of a whole — whether it's sale prices, test scores, or how much of a task is finished.

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to convert between these forms and use them in real-world problems. Being able to move between them will make you faster, more flexible, and more confident in math.

## 🔥 Warm-Up

1. What is ½ as a decimal? As a percent?

2. Which is more: 0.75 or 2⁄3?

3. What percent is the same as 3⁄4?

### 1.4.1 – What Are These Numbers Really Saying?

All three number types describe a **part of a whole**:

| Fraction | Decimal | Percent |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| ½        | 0.5     | 50%     |
| ¼        | 0.25    | 25%     |
| ¾        | 0.75    | 75%     |
| 1⁄10     | 0.1     | 10%     |

> ✔ They look different, but they mean the same thing.

### 1.4.2 – Converting Between Forms

#### Fraction → Decimal

Divide the top by the bottom
Example: 3⁄4 → 3 ÷ 4 = **0.75**

#### Decimal → Percent

Move the decimal two places to the right (×100)
0.75 → **75%**

#### Percent → Decimal

Move the decimal two places left (÷100)
25% → **0.25**

#### Decimal → Fraction

Say the number out loud
0.6 = “six tenths” = 6⁄10 → simplify to **3⁄5**

### 1.4.3 – Benchmarks Help You Think Fast

These values come up a lot — **know them by heart**:

| Fraction | Decimal | Percent |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| ½        | 0.5     | 50%     |
| ⅓        | 0.333…  | \~33%   |
| ¼        | 0.25    | 25%     |
| ¾        | 0.75    | 75%     |
| 1⁄5      | 0.2     | 20%     |

If you can picture these in your head, you'll be able to **estimate, compare, and calculate faster.**

### 1.4.4 – Real-Life Uses

You’ll see these forms all the time:

* **Shopping**: 20% off = pay 80% of the price
* **Grades**: 17 out of 20 = 85%
* **Weather**: 30% chance of rain
* **Data**: 40% of students passed = 4⁄10 = 0.4

:::{.callout-tip .realworld-box icon=false title="🌍 In the Real World"}
A store is having a 25% off sale. That means you only pay 75% of the price.
If a jacket costs \$60, then:

60 × 0.75 = \$45 → That’s your sale price.

## ✍️ Practice On Your Own

**Conversions**

1. Convert the following:

   a. ⅘ → decimal → percent
   b. 0.3 → fraction → percent
   c. 12.5% → decimal → fraction
   d. ⅛ → decimal (rounded) → percent (rounded)

---

**Real-World Problems**

2. You scored 18 out of 20 on a quiz. What is your:

   a. Fraction score
   b. Decimal score
   c. Percent score

3. A survey says 0.6 of people prefer vanilla. What is this as a:

   a. Fraction
   b. Percent

4. You get 30% off a \$50 pair of shoes. What do you pay?
