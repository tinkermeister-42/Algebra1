# 1.2 – Factors, Multiples & Prime Factorization {.unnumbered}

Have you ever tried to split something up evenly — like dividing pizza slices or organizing teams? That’s really what **factors** are all about: breaking numbers into equal parts.

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to identify factors and multiples — and how to break numbers into their prime building blocks using a tool called a factor tree. This may sound simple, but it is one of the most important tools you'll use later when solving equations and factoring algebraic expressions.

## 🔥 Warm-Up

1. List all the whole-number factors of 12.

2. What’s a multiple of 7 that is less than 50?

3. Is 11 a prime number? How do you know?

### 1.2.1 – What Are Factors?

A {{< glink factor >}} of a number is a whole number that divides it evenly — with no {{< glink remainder >}}.

**Example:**

The factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 2

That’s because:

1 × 12 = 12

2 × 6 = 12

3 × 4 = 12

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Can a number have just one factor?"}
Only one number does: **1**. It only has itself as a factor. That’s why it’s not considered prime *or* composite!

### 1.2.2 – What Are Multiples?

A {{< glink multiple >}} is what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, 4…

**Example:**

Here are the first few multiples of 5: 

$5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ...$

Multiples are useful when finding common denominators or common multiples later in algebra.

**Where have we seen this before?**

Multiples show up all over the place. When you skip count, you are using multiples. In the previous lesson, we used multiples to constuct number lines! 

**Example:**

Here is a number line that shows multiples of three.

### 1.2.3 – Prime vs. Composite

A **prime number** has only 2 factors: 1 and itself.
Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...

A **composite number** has more than 2 factors.
Examples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

### 1.2.4 – Prime Factorization and Factor Trees

Every number can be written as a **product of prime numbers**.

Let’s try 36.

Start with any two factors:
36
↙   ↘
6     6
↙ ↘   ↙ ↘
2  3   2  3

So the prime factorization is:
**2 × 2 × 3 × 3** or **2² × 3²**

This is called a **factor tree**. It doesn’t matter how you split the number at the start — you’ll always end up with the same prime pieces.

### 1.2.5 – Why Do Prime Factors Matter?

Later on, you'll use prime factorization to:

* Simplify fractions
* Find the **greatest common factor**
* Factor algebraic expressions
* Solve equations

So this isn't just about numbers — it's about developing tools that will unlock Algebra.
