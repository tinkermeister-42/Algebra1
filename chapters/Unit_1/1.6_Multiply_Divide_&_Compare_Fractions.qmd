# 1.5 – Multiply, Divide & Compare Fractions {.unnumbered}

In Algebra, you’ll work with fractions all the time — but not usually adding and subtracting them. What matters most is knowing how to **multiply**, **divide**, and **simplify** fractions to make expressions easier to work with.

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to multiply and divide fractions with confidence, and how to compare them logically. These are skills you’ll use throughout Algebra — especially when solving equations and simplifying rational expressions.

### 1.5.1 – Multiplying Fractions

Multiply straight across:

**Numerators × Numerators**
**Denominators × Denominators**

Example:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 6} = \frac{10}{18}
$$

Simplify: 10⁄18 → **5⁄9**

If possible, **simplify before multiplying**:

$$
\frac{4}{5} \times \frac{10}{12} = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{2 \times 5}{5 \times 6} = \frac{10}{30} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

### 1.5.2 – Multiplying Mixed Numbers

**Step 1:** Convert to improper fractions
**Step 2:** Multiply
**Step 3:** Simplify if needed

Example:
1½ × 2⁄3
→ 1½ = 3⁄2
→ 3⁄2 × 2⁄3 = 6⁄6 = **1**

---

### 1.5.3 – Dividing Fractions

To divide fractions, **multiply by the reciprocal** (flip the second fraction):

Example:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \div \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{15}{8}
$$

Mixed number: **1⅞**

Only flip the second fraction — the one you're dividing by.

### 1.5.4 – Comparing Fractions

#### Method 1: Use Benchmarks

Estimate which is closer to ½, ⅔, or 1.

#### Method 2: Use Common Denominators

Compare ⅔ and ¾
→ ⅔ = 8⁄12
→ ¾ = 9⁄12
✔ So ¾ is greater.

#### Method 3: Cross Multiply

$$
\frac{3}{5} \quad \text{vs.} \quad \frac{2}{3} \\
3 \times 3 = 9 \\
5 \times 2 = 10 \\
\text{Since 10 > 9, } \frac{2}{3} > \frac{3}{5}
$$

### 1.5.5 – Why This Matters in Algebra

You’ll use fraction multiplication and division when:

* Solving equations with fractional coefficients
* Simplifying rational expressions
* Finding slope
* Working with proportions

You're painting a wall. The can says it covers ⅔ of a room. You buy 3 cans.
How much will it cover?

3 × ⅔ = **2** → Enough for **2 rooms**

**1. Multiplication**

a. 6⁄15 = 2⁄5
b. 4⁄7 × 14⁄15 → cancel 7 & 14 → 4 × 2⁄1 × 15 = 8⁄15
c. 3⁄2 × 4⁄5 = 12⁄10 = 6⁄5 or 1⅕
d. 15⁄60 = 1⁄4

---

**2. Division**

a. ¾ ÷ ½ = ¾ × 2⁄1 = 6⁄4 = 1½
b. 2⁄5 × 4⁄3 = 8⁄15
c. 4⁄3 ÷ 2⁄3 = 4⁄3 × 3⁄2 = 12⁄6 = 2
d. 9⁄10 ÷ 3⁄5 = 9⁄10 × 5⁄3 = 45⁄30 = 3⁄2 = 1½

---

**3. Comparisons**

a. ⅔ < ¾
b. 3⁄5 < 2⁄3
c. 5⁄6 = 10⁄12
d. 7⁄10 > 2⁄3

---

**4. Recipe**

¾ × 2½ = ¾ × 5⁄2 = 15⁄8 = 1⅞ cups

**5. Cutting the board**

5⁄6 ÷ 3 = 5⁄6 × 1⁄3 = 5⁄18 meter per piece
