# 1.6 – Order of Operations {.unnumbered}

What does this equal?

$$
6 + 2 \times 3
$$

If you said 24 — you’re not alone. But that's **not** the correct answer. Math has rules for what to do first. These rules are called the **order of operations**, and they're essential for simplifying expressions the right way.

In this lesson, you'll learn to follow those rules consistently — even when negatives, fractions, and grouping are involved.

## 🔥 Warm-Up

1. Simplify: 3 + 6 × 2

2. True or False: (4 + 3) × 2 = 4 + (3 × 2)

3. What does ½ × (4 + 2) equal?

## 👥 Learn Together

### 1.6.1 – The Order Matters

The correct order is:

**P** – Parentheses
**E** – Exponents
**MD** – Multiply or Divide (left to right)
**AS** – Add or Subtract (left to right)

This is often remembered as **PEMDAS**.

> ⚠️ Multiply doesn’t always come before divide. Same with add and subtract. You go **left to right** when they appear together.

### 1.6.2 – Basic Examples

1.

$$
5 + 3 \times 2 = 5 + 6 = 11
$$

2.

$$
(5 + 3) \times 2 = 8 \times 2 = 16
$$

3.

$$
8 - 12 ÷ 3 = 8 - 4 = 4
$$

---

### 1.6.3 – Include Negatives & Fractions

Watch how signs and simplification interact:

**Example 1:**

$$
-3 \times (4 - 7) = -3 \times (-3) = 9
$$

**Example 2:**

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times (6 + 2) = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
$$

**Example 3:**

$$
\frac{3 + 5}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

$-3^2$ means $-(3^2) = -9$
but
$(-3)^2 = 9$
:::

---

### 1.6.4 – Complex Expressions

Put it all together:

**Example:**

$$
4 + \frac{1}{2} \times (6 - 2)^2
$$

Step 1: Parentheses → (6 - 2) = 4
Step 2: Exponents → 4² = 16
Step 3: Multiply → ½ × 16 = 8
Step 4: Add → 4 + 8 = **12**

### 1.6.5 – Why This Matters in Algebra

Later, expressions will include:

* **Variables**
* **Distributive property**
* **Combining like terms**

If students can’t simplify numbers correctly, the algebra won’t work either.

You get a 25% off coupon and a \$10 gift card. The item costs \$40.
Which should be applied first?

**25% of 40 = \$10 → pay \$30, then gift card = \$20**
But **40 - 10 = 30, then 25% off = \$22.50**

The order changes the result!

## ✍️ Practice On Your Own

**Basic Order of Operations**

1. Simplify:

   a. 4 + 6 × 2
   b. (4 + 6) × 2
   c. 12 ÷ 4 × 3
   d. 12 ÷ (4 × 3)

---

**Include Negatives & Fractions**

2. Simplify:

   a. -2 × (3 - 5)
   b. ½ × (8 + 4)
   c. (6 - 2)² ÷ 2
   d. (3 + 5) ÷ 2

---

**Expression Breakdown**

3. Simplify:

   a. 5 + 2 × (6 - 1)
   b. (12 - 4)² ÷ 4
   c. 10 - 3 × (2 + 1)
   d. ¾ × (12 - 4)

---

**Challenge**

4. Show two different ways to simplify:

$$
8 - 3 + 2
$$

Which is correct, and why?

5. Simplify:

$$
\frac{4 + 6 \div 3}{2}
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true title="🔑 Answer Key"}

**1. Basic**

a. 16
b. 20
c. 9
d. 1

---

**2. Negatives/Fractions**

a. -2 × (-2) = 4
b. ½ × 12 = 6
c. (4)² ÷ 2 = 16 ÷ 2 = 8
d. 8 ÷ 2 = 4

---

**3. Expressions**

a. 5 + 2 × 5 = 5 + 10 = 15
b. 8² ÷ 4 = 64 ÷ 4 = 16
c. 10 - 3 × 3 = 10 - 9 = 1
d. ¾ × 8 = 6

---

**4. Challenge**

8 - 3 + 2 = (8 - 3) + 2 = 5 + 2 = **7**
→ This is correct because subtraction and addition go **left to right**

---

**5. Final Problem**

6 ÷ 3 = 2 → 4 + 2 = 6 → 6 ÷ 2 = **3**
