# 1.6 – Solving Problems With Fractions, Decimals & Percents {.unnumbered}

Now that you know how to multiply and divide fractions, you're ready to apply those skills to real-life problems.

Fractions, decimals, and percents all show parts of a whole — but they’re used in different ways. We see them every day: in grades, prices, sales, surveys, and more.

In this lesson, you’ll practice choosing the right form for the situation, estimating or calculating accurately, and solving common problems like “What percent of this is that?” or “What do I need to score to get an A?”

- [ ] I can use fractions, decimals, and percents to solve real-world problems.
- [ ] I can find a part, a whole, or a percent in situations like "30 is 10% of what number?"
- [ ] I can use percents to solve problems involving grades, sales, and survey results.

## 🔥 Warm-Up

Use mental math if you can!

1. What is 10% of 60?

2. If a student scores 45 out of 50 points on a test, what percent did they earn?

3. A shirt costs $40. It’s 25% off. What’s the sale price?

## 👥 Learn Together

### 1.6.1 – What’s the Part, Whole, or Percent?

In many real-world problems, you’re given some information and asked to find what’s missing. Maybe you know the total price and the discount, and you want to know how much money you saved. Or you know how many questions you got right on a quiz, and you want to figure out your percent score.

These types of problems usually involve three pieces:

  - part (how much you have),

  - whole (the total or full amount),

  - percent (the portion out of 100).

If you know two of them, you can figure out the third. This formula helps:

$$
\text{part} = \text{percent} \times \text{whole}
$$

You can also rearrange it to solve for the percent or the whole. We’ll walk through all three types of problems step by step.

Converting the percent to a decimal will make calculations easier!

**Example 1 – Finding the Part**

What is 15% of 80?

You're looking for a small part of 80 — just 15 out of every 100. That’s what 15% means.

We can turn this into a math sentence by translating the words:

  - “is” becomes =

  - “of” becomes ×

So:

| what	| is	| 15%	| of	| 80?  |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| ?     | =     | $\times$ | 80   |

Now solve it:

$$
0.15×80=12
$$

So **12** is 15% of 80.


:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Try This: What is 10% of 50?"}
<br>
Turn it into a math sentence:

| what | is | 10%  | of | 50? |
| ---- | -- | ---- | -- | --- |
| ?    | =  | 0.10 | ×  | 50  |

Then multiply:

$$
0.10 \times 50 = 5
$$

**Answer: 5**

**Example 2 – Finding the Percent**

Out of 50 students, 30 say they like soccer. **What percent is that?**"

The phrase **out of** tells us that 50 is the **whole** and 30 is the **part**. We can write that as a fraction, then convert it into a percent.

$$
\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} = \frac{30}{50} = 0.6 = 60\%
$$

So **60%** of students like soccer.

:::{.callout-tip}

To find a percent, divide the part by the whole, then multiply by 100.

:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Your turn: If 3 out of 100 students get enough sleep, what percent is that?"}
<br>
$$
\frac{3}{100} = 0.03 = 3\%
$$

So only 3% of students get enough sleep!

:::

**Example 3 – Finding the Whole**

**25% of a number is 10. What is the number?**

We’re told that 10 is **25% of the total**. That means 10 is just a piece — one-fourth — of the whole. (Since 25% = 1/4.)

If one-fourth of something is 10, then we can picture the whole as being made up of **4 equal parts** of 10:

$$
10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40
$$

So the whole is **40**.

But what if it’s not so easy to think in fractions like 1/4? Here's a trick:

25% as a decimal is 0.25. If we want to know,  

> “0.25 of what number gives me 10?”  

we can work backward by **dividing**:

$$
10 \div 0.25 = 40
$$

So the total is still **40** — just another way to get the same answer.


:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Your turn: 20% of a number is 12. What is the number?"}
<br>
Start by thinking:  
20% = 1/5 → So if one-fifth is 12, then the whole must be:

$$
12 \times 5 = 60
$$

Or use division:  
$$
12 \div 0.2 = 60
$$

**Answer: 60**

### 1.6.2 – Real-Life Examples

#### Grades

Mr. Ross hands you back your Algebra quiz. You got 19 out of 20 points! **What is your grade?**

Grades are given as percentages so we want to figure out what $\frac{19}{20}$ is as a percent.

$$
\frac{19}{20} = 0.95 = 95\%
$$

You got **95%** on that assignment, that's an A!

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 If John got 20 out of 25 questions correct, what is his grade?"}

$$
\frac{20}{25} = 0.8 = 80\%
$$

John got an 80% which is a B.

#### Sales & Discounts

A clothing store is having a back-to-school sale. A $60 jacket is on sale for 25% off. **What’s the new price?**
<br>
First, find the discount by asking "What is 25% of $60?":

| what | is | 25%  | of | $60? |
| ---- | -- | ---- | -- | --- |
| ?    | =  | 0.25 | ×  | 60  |

$$
0.25 \times 60 = 15
$$

This tells us we will **save** $15. To find the new price we subtract:

$$
60 - 15 = 45
$$

The jacket now costs **$45**.

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 Swanhilda finds a $300 prom dress on sale at 65% off. What does the dress cost?"}

Find the discount:

| what | is | 65%  | of | $300? |
| ---- | -- | ---- | -- | --- |
| ?    | =  | 0.65 | ×  | 300  |

$$
0.65 \times 300 = 195
$$

Now subtract to get the sale price:

$$
300 - 195 = 105
$$

Swanhilda pays $105 for the dress. What a steal!

---

#### Surveys & Data

A survey of teachers asked whether they prefer cookies or cake. The survey found that 75% prefer cookies. If 120 of the teachers prefered cookies, how many teachers were surveyed?

Here we want to know the **whole** when we have a percent. First, convert 75% to a decimal:

$$
75\% = 0.75
$$

Then divide:

$$
120 \div 0.75 = 160
$$

**160 teachers** were surveyed.

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple" collapse=true title="🧠 A survey asked Missourians if they support Proposition A. 550 (or 55%) said they **do** support it. How many people were surveyed?"}
<br>
First, convert to a decimal:

$$
55\% = 0.55
$$

Then divide:

$$
550 \div 0.55 = 1000
$$

**1000** Missourians were surveyed.
