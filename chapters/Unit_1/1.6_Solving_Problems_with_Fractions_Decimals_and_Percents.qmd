# 1.6 ‚Äì Solving Problems With Fractions, Decimals & Percents {.unnumbered}

Now that you know how to multiply and divide fractions, you're ready to apply those skills to real-life problems.

Fractions, decimals, and percents all show parts of a whole ‚Äî but they‚Äôre used in different ways. We see them every day: in grades, prices, sales, surveys, and more.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll practice choosing the right form for the situation, estimating or calculating accurately, and solving common problems like ‚ÄúWhat percent of this is that?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat do I need to score on the test to get an A?‚Äù

## üî• Warm-Up

Use mental math if you can!

1. Is 10% of 60 bigger or smaller than 30?

2. Is 21 out of 35 a good score on a test?

3. What does it mean to say something is on sale for 25% off?

### 1.6.1 ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Part, Whole, or Percent?

In many real-world problems, you‚Äôre given some information and need to find what‚Äôs missing. Maybe you know the total price and the discount, and you want to know how much money you saved. Or you know how many questions you got right on a quiz, and you want to figure out your percent score.

These types of problems usually involve three pieces:

  - part (how much you have),

  - whole (the total or full amount),

  - percent (the portion out of 100).

If you know two of them, you can figure out the third. This formula helps:

$$
\text{part} = \text{percent} \times \text{whole}
$$

You can also rearrange it to solve for the percent or the whole. We‚Äôll walk through all three types of problems step by step.


:::{.remember}
Convert the percent to a decimal first!

**Example 1 ‚Äì Finding the Part**

What is 15% of 80?

You're looking for a small part of 80 ‚Äî just 15 out of every 100. That‚Äôs what 15% means.

We can turn this into a math sentence by translating the words:

  - ‚Äúis‚Äù becomes equals (=)
  - ‚Äúof‚Äù becomes times (&times;)

So:

| what	| is	| 15%	| of	| 80?  |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| ?     | =     | 0.15  |$\times$ | 80   |

Now solve it:

$$
0.15√ó80=12
$$

So **12** is 15% of 80.


:::{.you-try title="What is 10% of 50?"}

Turn it into a math sentence:

| what | is | 10%  | of | 50? |
| ---- | -- | ---- | -- | --- |
| ?    | =  | 0.10 | √ó  | 50  |

Then multiply:
$$
0.10 \times 50 = 5
$$
**Answer: 5**

**Example 2 ‚Äì Finding the Percent**

Out of 50 students, 30 say they like soccer. **What percent is that?**

The phrase **out of** tells us that 50 is the **whole** and 30 is the **part**. We can write that as a fraction, then convert it into a percent.

$$
\frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} = \frac{30}{50} = 0.6 = 60\%
$$

So **60%** of students like soccer.

:::{.you-try title="If 3 out of 75 students get enough sleep, what percent is that?"}
$$
\frac{3}{75} = 0.04 = 4\%
$$
So only 4% of students get enough sleep!
:::

---

**Example 3 ‚Äì Finding the Whole**

**25% of a number is 10. What is the number?**

We‚Äôre told that 10 is **25% of the total**. That means 10 is just a piece ‚Äî one-fourth ‚Äî of the whole. (Since $25\% = \frac{1}{4}$.)

If one-fourth of something is 10, then we can picture the whole as being made up of **4 equal parts** of 10:

$$
10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40
$$

So the whole is **40**.

But what if the fractions are harder to think about than $\frac{1}{4}$? Here's a trick:

25% as a decimal is 0.25. If we want to know,  

> ‚Äú25% of what number gives me 10?‚Äù  

we can work backward by **dividing**:

$$
10 \div 0.25 = 40
$$

So the total is still **40** ‚Äî it is just another way to get the same answer.


:::{.you-try title="20% of a number is 12. What is the number?"}
Start by thinking:  

$20\% = \frac{1}{5}$ ‚Üí So if one-fifth is 12, then the whole must be:
$$
12 \times 5 = 60
$$
Or use division:  
$$
12 \div 0.2 = 60
$$
**Answer: 60**

### 1.6.2 ‚Äì Real-Life Examples

#### Grades

Your teacher hands you back your Unit 1 quiz. You got 19 out of 20 points! **What is your grade?**

Grades are given as percentages so we want to figure out what $\frac{19}{20}$ is as a percent.

$$
\frac{19}{20} = 0.95 = 95\%
$$

You got **95%** on that assignment, that's an A!

:::{.you-try title="If John got 20 out of 25 questions correct, what is his grade?"}
$$
\frac{20}{25} = 0.8 = 80\%
$$
John got an 80% which is a B.

#### Sales & Discounts

A clothing store is having a back-to-school sale. A $60 jacket is on sale for 25% off. 

**What‚Äôs the new price?**


First, find the {{< glink discount >}} by asking "What is 25% of $60?":

| what | is | 25%  | of | $60? |
| ---- | -- | ---- | -- | --- |
| ?    | =  | 0.25 | √ó  | 60  |

$$
0.25 \times 60 = 15
$$

This tells us we will **save** $15. To find the new price we subtract:

$$
60 - 15 = 45
$$

The jacket now costs **$45**.

:::{.you-try title="Swanhilda finds a $300 prom dress on sale at 65% off. What does the dress cost?"}

Find the discount:

| what | is | 65%  | of | $300? |
| ---- | -- | ---- | -- | --- |
| ?    | =  | 0.65 | √ó  | 300  |

$$
0.65 \times 300 = 195
$$
Now subtract to get the sale price:
$$
300 - 195 = 105
$$
Swanhilda pays $105 for the dress. What a steal!
:::

---

#### Surveys & Data

A {{<glink survey >}} of teachers asked whether they prefer cookies or cake. The survey found that 75% prefer cookies. If 120 of the teachers preferred cookies, how many teachers were surveyed?

Here we want to know the **whole** when we have a percent. First, convert 75% to a decimal:
$$
75\% = 0.75
$$
Then divide:
$$
120 \div 0.75 = 160
$$
**160 teachers** were surveyed.

:::{.callout-tip}
To help avoid silly mistakes, ask yourself first, **"What answer do I expect?"**. This will help you decide if the answer you get makes sense.
:::

:::{.you-try title="If a survey found 550 -- which is 55% -- like cucumbers. How many students were surveyed?"}
First, convert to a decimal:
$$
55\% = 0.55
$$
Then divide:
$$
550 \div 0.55 = 1000
$$
**1000** students were surveyed.
