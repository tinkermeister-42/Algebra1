# Supplemental Materials {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the **Supplemental Materials** section of this course! This is where you'll find all the fun, extra, and just plain interesting math content that doesn't quite fit into the main units â€” but still helps build understanding, spark curiosity, or offer a little challenge.

Use these resources to:
- Practice your skills in new and creative ways
- Explore math puzzles and logic games
- Reinforce key concepts from class
- Take a brain break with something still mathy (but fun!)
