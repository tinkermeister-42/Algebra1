### absolute value {#glossary-absolute-value}

The distance a number is from zero on a number line, always expressed as a positive number or zero.

> Example: The **absolute value** of `-7` is `7`.

### Algebra {#glossary-algebra}

Algebra is a branch of math that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and relationships.

Instead of just solving problems with numbers, algebra lets us write rules, patterns, and equations that work for many situations.

---

### Calculus {#glossary-calculus}

Calculus is a branch of math that helps us understand change and motion.

Itâ€™s used to study things like how fast something is moving, how things are growing or shrinking, or how to find the exact area under a curve.

---

### greater than {#glossary-greater-than}

A number is greater than (**&gt;**) another number if it is further to the right on the number line.

> Example $5 > 3$ is true
> ![Greater than true example](images/Glossary/greater_than_true.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}
> but $3 > 5$ is false
> ![Greater than false example](images/Glossary/greater_than_false.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}

---

### horizontal {#glossary-horizontal}

Side to side, like the horizon. Level ground is horizontal.

> Example: This is a horizontal number line.

### integer {#glossary-integer}

In mathematics, an integer is a whole number (not a fraction or decimal) that can be positive, negative, or zero. Examples include -3, 0, 5, and 100. 

---

### less than {#glossary-less-than}

A number is less than (**&lt;**) another number if it is further to the left on the number line.

> Example $3 < 5$ is true
> ![Greater than true example](images/Glossary/less_than_true.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}
> but $5 < 3$ is false
> ![Greater than false example](images/Glossary/less_than_false.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}

---

### number line {#glossary-number-line}

A straight line used to represent numbers in order. It usually has zero in the middle, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left. Number lines help visualize operations and compare values.

> Example: $-2$, $0$, and $3$ are all on the number line.
> ![Number line example](images/Glossary/number_line_example.png){#fig-number-line width="100%"}

---

### negative {#glossary-negative}

A number is negative if it is less than zero. On a number line, negative numbers are to the left of zero.

> Example: `-4` is a **negative** number.

---

### opposite {#glossary-opposite}

Two numbers that are the same distance from zero on a number line, but on opposite sides. Their sum is always zero.

> Example: `-3` and `3` are **opposite** numbers.

---

### positive {#glossary-positive}

A number is positive if it is greater than zero. On a number line, positive numbers are to the right of zero.

> Example: `5` is a **positive** number.

---

### vertical {#glossary-vertical}

Up and down like a flag pole.

> Example: This is a vertical number line.
